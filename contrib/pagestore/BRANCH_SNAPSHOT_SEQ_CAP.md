# Branch snapshot seq cap: a read-side same-position freeze for Bug B

**Status:** **Design frozen for implementation (2026-09-25), revision 9.** Changes made during implementation are recorded as amendments in the phase PRs. Items that code review must confirm are listed in §10.
- Rev 9 (final) addresses round 7 (4101392015/4101392022/4101392030/4101392035/4101392043/4101392050); adds §10 and the detailed P1 scope (§9.3).
- Rev 2 addressed PR #297 Codex round 1 and PR #296 comment 4100769750.
- Rev 3 addresses round 2: 4100994214/4100994220/4100994223/4100994229/4100994233/4100994236.
- Rev 4 replaces the rev-3 G3 attestation and core hook with compute-side proofs R1 and R2 (§7).
- Rev 5 addresses round 3 (4101119417/4101119423/4101119428/4101119435): R1 removed; R2 requires a shutdown checkpoint; exact-retry-safe post-check; R2 moved into P3b.
- Rev 8 addresses round 6 (4101315034/4101315039/4101315045): unproven retries of a finite branch are refused; pins are sampled and registered atomically (§2.3); WAL-index publication switches under admission-wr.
- Rev 7 addresses round 5 (4101247317/4101247321/4101247324): the gate exemption is keyed on the activation epoch; capability plus `R2_PROVEN` gating for CREATE_BRANCH; sentinel-safe observe (§3.8).
- Rev 6 addresses round 4 (4101176465/4101176475/4101176481/4101176487/4101176495): the gate matches the full cap; the R2 commit proof comes from a WAL scan; cleanup order is manifest first, then delete; activation epochs (§2.2, §9.2).

**Baseline:** `origin/pagestore` @ `0550146156d`. Line references are to that tree.

**Supersedes:** the admission-time LSN promotion in PR #294 (`d504a7af748`), abandoned 2026-09-25.

**Keeps from #294:**
- the per-opcode `ls_op_lsn()` fallback (P0, PR #296, with `+1`, §5.2);
- the child-first CREATE-retry idempotence check `fork_newest_definitive_event_through()` (§6.2);
- the Bug B regression suites, as acceptance tests (§6.2).

## 0. Problem and constraints

**Bug B.** A COW branch reads its ancestors through `tl_walk_next()` (`pagestore_core.c:7362`). That walk caps each ancestor level by `branch_lsn` only, and every ancestor hop passes `seq_cap = 0` (all `seq_cap = w.lsn == read_lsn ? read_seq : 0` sites). So anything the parent admits after the fork at a position ≤ `branch_lsn` is visible to the branch:
- a hint-bit-only rewrite under an unchanged `pd_lsn = p ≤ L` wins by a larger `admission_seq` at the same LSN (`page_visible()`, `:5544`);
- a fork event whose `req_lsn ≤ L` changes the branch's size or existence.

A branch reuses XIDs the parent later commits under a different meaning, so post-fork hint bits are corruption for it, not staleness.

**Why not promotion.** In #294 the LSN served as both the branch-visibility coordinate and the parent's version order. Moving it to fix the first kept breaking the second (V4–V7, G1, G2). This design never moves an admitted record; parent newest reads keep today's `(lsn, admission_seq)` order bit for bit.

**Why not a pure 2D cap** (`lsn ≤ L ∧ seq ≤ S`). Honest late admissions must stay visible:
- `pagestore_test.c:4631` (block 5 written at 1200 after the branch at 1500 is visible to the branch);
- #294's `rel100` (a genuine first admission exactly at L is visible).

**Goal.** A read-side rule parameterized by a per-view `cap_seq` that:
1. hides same-position rewrites admitted after the view froze;
2. keeps honest first admissions visible;
3. is *stable*: no later admission, prune, compaction or restart changes a resolution;
4. is retainable, including the facts the rule depends on (`s_min(p)`);
5. has **no correctness dependence on the order of view registration, recovery, or maintenance** beyond the locks that already serialize retention (rev 3 principle; §9.1).

## 1. Semantics

### 1.1 Positions

| Object | Position | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Relation page version | `(level, key, block, lsn = pd_lsn)` | The bytes self-certify their WAL position. Same-position versions differ only in unlogged state. |
| Object version (SLRU / CONTROL / SLRU_LIVE/TOMB/WM / READER_SNAPSHOT / ARTIFACT) | `(level, key, block, version)`, where `version` is the caller's WAL LSN (`:16907-16944`) | The equality edge is audited in §5.3. |
| Fork event, **META** class: SET (CREATE/TRUNCATE), DEAD (UNLINK), GROW from ZEROEXTEND | `(level, key, lsn)` | Logical operations. |
| Fork event, **PAGE** class: GROW derived from a page append (`fork_grow_apply`, `FEV_SEG_GROW*`) | `(level, key, lsn, block = nblocks-1)`, mirroring its page version (§1.3) | Must agree with page visibility. |
| Inert markers | n/a | No size effect. |

### 1.2 View caps and composition

```
ViewCap { uint64 lsn;          /* L */
          uint64 seq;          /* S (PS_SEQ_UNBOUNDED = ∞) */
          uint64 strict_seq; } /* X: extra bound at position == L */
```

- **Branch edge** `(L_e, S_e, X = ∞)`.
- **Retention pin / exact-R reader** `(R, S_r, X = S_r)`.
- **Newest read** `(∞, ∞, ∞)`.
- **Seq-less as-of read** `(R, ∞, ∞)` (today's semantics, deliberately unchanged).

**Composition across edge `(L_e, S_e)`.** This is the single function used by `tl_walk_next`, `retention_project_cap`, the gates and all fence builders:

```
lsn'        = min(lsn, L_e)
seq'        = min(seq, S_e)
strict_seq' = (L_e < lsn) ? ∞ : strict_seq
```

**Composition is exact (the intersection of the constituents' admissible sets).** Write the admissible set of a constraint `i = (L_i, S_i, X_i)` at level `k` as (§1.3):

```
A_i = { v : p ≤ L_i ∧ (p < L_i ∨ v.seq ≤ X_i) ∧ (v.seq ≤ S_i ∨ esc_k(v)) }
```

where `esc_k(v) ≡ p > B_k ∧ v.seq == s_min_k(p)` depends only on the level and the position, **not on i**. Then for `L = min L_i`:

- `p ≤ L_i` for all i ⟺ `p ≤ L`;
- for `p < L` every boundary conjunct is true;
- at `p = L`, constraints with `L_i > L` are satisfied by `p < L_i`, and those with `L_i = L` require `v.seq ≤ X_i`. So the conjunct is `v.seq ≤ min{X_i : L_i = L}`, which is what `strict_seq'` computes (an edge that lowers L carries `X = ∞`);
- `∩_i (v.seq ≤ S_i ∨ esc) = (v.seq ≤ min S_i) ∨ esc`, because `esc` is common to all i.

Hence `A_composed = ∩ A_i` exactly, **also under STRICT**. Rev 2 disabled `esc` at the strict boundary. That made the composition stricter than the intersection, which is Codex 4100994223.

**Worked example.**
- Setup: branch edge `S_e = 10` at `L_e ≥ R`; the root's first event at `p = R` has seq 15; an exact-R pin on the branch has `S_r = 20`.
- The composed cap at the root level is `(R, 10, 20)`.
- The event passes `p ≤ R`; passes `p = R ⇒ 15 ≤ X = 20`; and, since `15 > 10`, needs `esc`: the root has `B = −∞` and seq 15 is `s_min(R)`. So it is **visible**.
- This matches both constituents: the branch admits it as a first arrival, and the pin admits it since `15 ≤ 20`.
- A second arrival at R with seq 25 fails `X`, so it is hidden.

### 1.3 The rule

For level `k` with cap `(L, S, X)`, position `p`, `V(p)` the entries at `p` on level `k`, `s_min(p)` the min seq in `V(p)` (legacy seq 0 counts as 0), and `B_k` = `branch_lsn` of timeline `k` (`−∞` for the root):

```
admissible(v) ⟺ p ≤ L ∧ (p < L ∨ v.seq ≤ X) ∧ ( v.seq ≤ S ∨ (p > B_k ∧ v.seq == s_min(p)) )
```

- **Pages:** the admissible version with the greatest `(lsn, seq)`. That is: the newest position with any admissible version; there, the newest version with `seq ≤ S` if one exists, otherwise the first arrival.
- **META fork events:** the hop fold over admissible events in `(lsn, seq)` order.
- **PAGE-class GROW:** admissible iff `p ≤ L ∧ (p < L ∨ seq ≤ X) ∧ (seq ≤ S ∨ p > B_k)`. It is never filtered by first-arrival status (it mirrors a page version; a hidden same-position page rewrite's GROW duplicates the visible version's `nblocks`). It is filtered in the inherited range exactly like its page.
- **UNSTAMPED:** `p ≤ L ∧ (p < L ∨ seq ≤ X) ∧ seq ≤ S` (§1.6).
- **Legacy seq 0** is `≤ S` for every S.

**At `S = X = ∞`** this is exactly today's `page_visible(e, L, 0)` and the cached prefix fold, which is the legacy-branch equivalence (§4.1).

### 1.4 Validation

| Case | Outcome |
|---|---|
| Honest late, no pre-fork version at `p ≤ L`, `p > B_k` | First arrival, visible. `:4631` and `rel100` pass. |
| Pre-fork version at `p`, then a post-fork rewrite | The newest pre-S version is chosen (`rel103`, revision-1, control). |
| Stale META at 1000 with CREATE@1000 pre-fork | Non-first post-S META is hidden (`rel101`, `rel105`, ancestry-5). |
| Multi-block record, block 7 flushed post-fork at a `p` shared with pre-fork block 5 | Page 7 is first at `(7,p)`; its PAGE GROW is admissible. Consistent. |
| Honest in-flight ZEROEXTEND at an occupied META position | Hidden. Acceptable by crash equivalence. |
| Child-local post-S write at `p ≤ B_child` (ancestry-1/2) | Hidden (§1.5). |
| First root event at the strict boundary under a composed pin | Visible iff `seq ≤ X` (§1.2 example). |

**Ambiguity (several post-fork arrivals, none pre-fork): first arrival.**
- For relation pages the label is the content, so later arrivals only add unlogged bits.
- The first arrival is immutable, provided retention keeps it (closure, §3.5–§3.7).
- It is admissible to every view reaching `p > B_k`.
- It can be wrong only through bits it already carried (G3, closed in §7), or through a synthetic object/META label at a fresh position (§5.2 gives synthetic labels a position strictly after every existing cut).

**Crash equivalence.** A branch restores control at or below L and replays WAL to L. Hiding an honest in-flight admission at an occupied position equals losing it in a crash at L. The rule may err toward hiding at an occupied position, never toward revealing a rewrite.

### 1.5 The inherited range

On a branch timeline `k`, positions `p ≤ B_k` are inherited history, and the first-arrival escape is disabled there.
- Relation pages on a branch are already clamped above `B_k` (`branch_floor`, `:16890`).
- Other local writes at `p ≤ B_k` are one of three kinds:
  - preparation or first-boot replay and seeding, which happen before any descendant or pin of `k` exists, so they are pre-S for all of its views;
  - later re-applications (duplicates);
  - stale labels.
- The rule is local (it depends only on the immutable `B_k` and on `k`'s own entries), so retention elsewhere cannot change it.
- Ancestry-1 and ancestry-2 are hidden from tl2 and remain visible to tl1's newest reads.

### 1.6 Unstamped records

Admissible to a capped view iff `lsn ≤ L ∧ (lsn < L ∨ seq ≤ X) ∧ seq ≤ S`. At `S = ∞` this is today's behaviour. Placement is in §5.

---

## 2. Which views carry a cap_seq

**Invariant I-ALLOC.** Every `admission_seq` that ends up indexed is allocated and published within one hold of that key's shard write lock, under admission-rd.
- Daemon paths comply: `:16876`, `:6984`, `:20403/20488/20553/20583`.
- P1 asserts it.
- Exempt: the barrier (`:1834`), pin SET (`:20950`), and artifact tokens.

**Stable seq.** `next_admission_seq - 1` read under all shard locks, or any seq allocated under admission-wr.

**Registration.** Every view with finite S or finite X is registered at the level it reads. A capped read whose composed **full cap `(level, L, S, X)`** does not match a registered view is rejected (§3.5). Views that predate their kind's activation are interpreted as ∞ (§2.2).

| View | cap_seq | When / locks | Persistence | Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Branch** `branch_seq` | `admission_seq_alloc()` inside CREATE_BRANCH (unused by any record; pre-S means `seq < S`) | admission-rd + all shard-wr + map-wr (`pagestore_daemon.c:766-777`). Exact retries return the persisted S; a DELETED id reuse allocates fresh. The G3 proof (R2, §7) is checked on the compute side immediately before and after this request, in the same backend. The daemon reports whether this call newly created the timeline in `ch->result`. | `TimelineRecEventV3.branch_seq` | `admission_seq_observe` (required) |
| **Retention pin** | `pin.admission_seq` (under admission-wr, `:20948-20951`) | stable | retention log | existing |
| **Exact-R / advancing reader** | `(R, S)` from `ps_admission_barrier()` (`:1828`), which now **registers a fence pin in the same admission-wr section** (§2.3) | stable. A reader's own pin at `(R, S)` is a *hand-off* from a live registration with the identical cap, never a later registration of a sampled seq (§2.3). | retention log (new owner kind `CHECKPOINT_FENCE`) | existing |
| **Artifact fence** | `S_a` = `begin_seq` of the committed attempt, plus a transient `inflight` token cap (§2.1) | bound at COMMIT, under the artifact key's shard lock | `PsArtifactLifecycle.begin_seq` (lifecycle v2, `pagestore_artifact_format.h:47`); **no format change** | rebuilt from completion records |
| **WAL-index horizon** | `S_H`, stable-sampled in `walidx_commit()` (shard 0 already held in write mode; shards 1..n-1 taken in read mode, ascending, before `walidx_publish_wrlock`) | order: shard(asc) → walidx_publish → wal_lock → walidx_meta | WIPG v2 and WISD v4 | `admission_seq_observe` (finite values only, §3.8) |
| **Materializer marker** | none (its view is its MATERIALIZER pin) | – | – | – |
| **Forkmeta cutoff** | not a view (lexicographic compaction boundary) | – | – | – |
| **Page frontier** `(F_lsn, F_seq)` | not a view | – | – | – |

### 2.1 Artifact fence caps

An `ArtifactFence` entry (`:18474`) holds a small cap set:
- `committed`: `begin_seq` from the durable COMMIT record at C;
- `inflight`: the current unfinished attempt's token, added at BEGIN and at `artifact_fence_reserve()` (`:16971`).

Transitions:
- COMMIT moves the token from `inflight` to `committed`.
- A superseding BEGIN, a DROP of an unfinished attempt, or a restart drops the `inflight` cap. Unfinished attempts cannot commit after a restart.
- Failed attempts never contribute.
- A DROP followed by a same-C re-publication may briefly hold two committed caps, until the existing release.

**Producer requirement (audited in P5).** The producer reads the control era it embeds with `(C, token)`. Legacy lifecycle-less seeds use `S_a = ∞`.

### 2.2 Activation epochs (rev 6; 4101176487/4101176495)

**Problem.** A view whose seq predates activation of finite caps for its kind was retained under the old rules. Pre-S versions, first arrivals and masked fork history it would need under the new rule may already have been pruned. Interpreting it with a finite S retroactively would silently change what it reads.

**Principle.** A view is servable with a finite cap **iff its seq was allocated after its kind was activated**. For a view allocated after activation, every version or event existing at its creation is pre-S, so its selection at every position is the newest retained version, which old retention always kept. Everything after it is governed by the new retention.

**Mechanism.**
- One durable record per view kind, `CAP_ACTIVATION {kind, activation_seq}`, a new `TIMELINE_META_EVENT_CAP_ACTIVATION` in the V3 timelines log.
  - The format is defined in P3a. It is written by the first binary that activates that kind: P3b for `BRANCH`, P5 for `PIN`, `WALIDX_HORIZON` and `ARTIFACT`.
  - The binary writes it during open, after recovery and before serving requests, with `activation_seq = admission_seq_alloc()` under admission-wr. So it is stable, and it is observed on replay.
- The rule: `effective_S(view) = (view.seq > activation_seq[kind]) ? view.seq : ∞`.
- A **pre-activation strict view** (a pin or an exact-R read whose seq is at or below `activation_seq[PIN]`) is interpreted as **`(R, ∞, S_r)` and marked `legacy`**.
  - `legacy` exempts it from the registration gate (§3.5), so it behaves exactly as today: the tuple fence at R (READ_CONSISTENCY_DESIGN §1d) plus today's `page_frontier_allows` rules.
  - **Deviation from the round-5 decision, for review (4101247317).** The decision proposed mapping such reads to `(R, ∞, ∞)`. That would *drop* §1d's implemented same-LSN fence at R, so a pre-activation reader would newly see a post-pin rewrite at exactly R. That is a regression, not today's behaviour. Keying the gate exemption on the activation epoch rather than on `X == ∞` fixes the finding without changing any existing reader's results.
  - If reviewers still prefer `(R, ∞, ∞)`, it is a one-line change in the cap constructor. The regression it introduces would then have to be accepted explicitly.
- The rule is applied in one place: the view-cap constructor used by reads, fence builders and the registration gate. Retention and reads therefore always agree.

| View kind | Its seq | Pre-activation behaviour | Extra persistence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Branch | `branch_seq` | **P3a writes `branch_seq = PS_SEQ_UNBOUNDED`** (4101176487). A finite value is written only by a P3b binary. `branch_seq ≤ activation_seq[BRANCH]` also maps to ∞, which is redundant but uniform. An exact CREATE retry returns the persisted value, so a branch created by P3a stays ∞. | none beyond V3 |
| Retention pin (reader, owner, materializer) | `pin.admission_seq` (existing) | ∞ (today's STRICT-at-R) | none |
| Exact-R / advancing reader | `(R, S)` from the barrier | `req_seq ≤ activation_seq[PIN]` gives `(R, ∞, S)` marked `legacy`: today's semantics, not gated | none |
| WAL-index horizon | `S_H` | **P3a writes `S_H = ∞`** in WIPG v2 / WISD v4. The first `walidx_commit()` after P5 activation records a finite `S_H` for the *new* horizon. That view is fresh, so the principle applies. | none beyond WIPG v2 |
| Artifact fence | committed attempt's `begin_seq` (existing) | ∞ (LSN-only fence, as today) | none |

**Downgrade.** A binary older than the activating phase must not open a store with a `CAP_ACTIVATION` record for a kind it does not implement. P3a's loader treats that record as "requires a newer binary" and fails closed. Otherwise its retention would prune history that finite views need.

### 2.3 Atomic sampling and registration of pins (rev 8; 4101315039)

**Problem.** Today an exact-R fence `(R, S)` is sampled by `ps_admission_barrier()` (`:1828-1839`; it only reserves S in the retention high-water mark, `ps_retention_reserve_admission_seq`, `pagestore_retention.c:1127`). A pin at that `(R, S)` is registered *later*, via PIN_SET with an explicit seq (`pin.admission_seq = ch->nblocks | ch->pad1 << 32`, `:20826-20829`). In between, a prune that does not know the view can drop the pre-S versions or first arrivals it needs. The frontier check at SET time is lexicographic and does not detect this.

**Rule: a finite-S view exists only if it was registered in the same critical section that sampled S, or handed off from a live registration with the identical cap.**
- **RESERVE** (`PS_OP_RETENTION_PIN_RESERVE`, `:20927-21000`) already allocates `seq` under admission-wr and calls `ps_retention_reserve_and_set()` (`pagestore_retention.c:1101-1124`). It is atomic as is, and is the default way to create a fresh reader or owner pin.
- **ADMISSION_BARRIER** (`ps_admission_barrier`, `:1828`) becomes atomic too. The request carries `R` in `req_lsn` and the magic `PS_BARRIER_REGISTER` in `is_redo`: channel fields are not reset between requests, so a magic is needed, as in §7.
  - The daemon takes exactly the RESERVE path's locks and checks (`pagestore_core.c:20948-20995`): `admission-wr → page_prune_lock (wr) → walidx_prune_lock (wr)`, then map-rd for validation (round 7, 4101392015).
  - It allocates S and validates `page_frontier_ancestry_allows(tl, R, S)` (and the WAL/WAL-index frontier checks RESERVE performs). On failure it refuses the barrier and allocates no fence.
  - It then calls `ps_retention_reserve_and_set()` with a pin `{timeline, owner_kind = CHECKPOINT_FENCE, lsn = R, resources = PAGE_HISTORY | WAL | WAL_INDEX, admission_seq = S}` and returns S.
  - Holding `page_prune_lock` (wr) excludes a compaction that snapshotted fences before the registration from publishing after it.
  - `CHECKPOINT_FENCE` pins are daemon-owned. The daemon keeps the newest two per timeline, so a reader adopting the previous generation still has a window, and drops older ones on each new barrier, which marks prune due.
  - Without the magic (an old compute), the barrier behaves as today. Its S is post-activation and unregistered, so readers cannot hand off from it and fail closed until the compute is upgraded.
- **PIN_SET with an explicit seq** becomes a **hand-off only**. Under `retention_lock` plus `page_prune_lock` (write), which is the same exclusion compaction uses to snapshot fences, it succeeds only if a live registration with the identical `(timeline, lsn, admission_seq)` exists (a `CHECKPOINT_FENCE` pin, or another owner's pin) **whose resources are a superset of the requested resources** (round 7, 4101392022). For example, a WAL-only source cannot hand off `PAGE_HISTORY`, because the page fence set never included it. It also holds `walidx_prune_lock` (wr) when `WAL_INDEX` is requested. Otherwise it returns the new refusal `PS_RETENTION_NOT_REGISTERED`. So no prune can run between the moment the cap is known to be protected and the new owner's registration.
- **Pre-activation pins and reads** (seq at or below `activation_seq[PIN]`) keep today's SET semantics (legacy).

**P5 version gate** (round 7, 4101392043).
- P5 changes the semantics of existing opcodes: the barrier registers, explicit PIN_SET is hand-off only, artifact BEGIN implies `(C, token)` reads. So **P5 bumps `PS_SHM_VERSION`**. A P4 daemon and a P5 compute, or the reverse, refuse to attach, and neither mixed direction can proceed silently.
- **Within P5** (same version), the daemon still enforces its side after activation:
  - a post-activation barrier without `PS_BARRIER_REGISTER` is refused;
  - an explicit-seq PIN_SET for a post-activation seq that is not a valid hand-off is refused;
  - after `CAP_ACTIVATION{ARTIFACT}`, an artifact BEGIN is accepted only with the new flag `PS_ARTIFACT_BEGIN_CAPPED_READ` (a magic in an unused field). This is the producer's promise to read its control era with `(C, token)`.
- The P5 client checks the daemon capability `PS_FRONTEND_CAP_ATOMIC_PINS` before using any of these paths.

**Call sites that change (P5):**

| Call site | Today | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `pagestore_retention_set` SQL (`pagestore.c:~1070-1125`) | reads the checkpoint's durable admission fence (`pagestore_localsvc_read_fence_for_timeline_timeout`), then PIN_SETs at `(lsn, fence_seq)` | becomes a hand-off from the `CHECKPOINT_FENCE` pin |
| `pagestore.c:9884`, `pagestore.c:12355` (reader artifact / automatic reader paths) | explicit-seq SET | hand-off, or RESERVE when the exact barrier seq is not semantically required |
| `pagestore_control.c:241` (control drain barrier) | barrier | sends `R` and `PS_BARRIER_REGISTER` |
| `pagestore_branch_prepare.py:1015-1060` (`install_branch_retention` via `pagestore_retention_set` at the SLRU base) | explicit-seq SET | hand-off from the fence at that checkpoint, or RESERVE, which gives a fresh S; every retained newest version at or below the base is then pre-S, so the seed still resolves |
| `continuous_redo_demo.sh:360` | explicit-seq SET | hand-off |

**Formats.** The new `owner_kind` value is persisted in the existing retention record shape. The retention identity is bumped in P3a (formats first), and old binaries reject the unknown kind, so they fail closed.

## 3. Code touch points

### 3.1 Read path, pages

- `page_visible()` → `page_select(e, const ViewCap *c, uint64 B_k, ...)` (`:5544`): find `p*`; there take the newest with `seq ≤ S` (and `≤ X` if `p* == L`); otherwise the min-seq version if `p* > B_k` and it satisfies `X`; otherwise step down a position. O(nver). `page_visible` stays as a wrapper for uncapped callers.
- `TlWalk` (`:7338-7372`) carries a `ViewCap` and `B_k`. Every `seq_cap = w.lsn == read_lsn ? read_seq : 0` is deleted (`:7651`, `:17631`, `:7718`, `:7815`, `:7787`, `:7383`, `fork_asof_query_allowed`).
- Memtable and layer lookups (`:17694`, `:17703`) are called with the selected identity `(pv->lsn, pv->admission_seq)`.
- LSN-0 relation bytes at ancestor levels keep failing closed (`:7663`, `:17660`).

### 3.2 Read path, fork events; GROW recording

**In-memory state** (`sizeof(ForkEvent) == 40` stays):
- the `snapshot_dropped` byte becomes flags: bit0 `SNAPSHOT_DROPPED`, bit1 `META`, bit2 `META_FIRST`, bit3 `UNSTAMPED`;
- `ForkEnt` gains `max_meta_seq`, defined as the **max seq over the META/UNSTAMPED events currently present**. It is recomputed exactly on load and after in-memory compaction; it is a pure function of the present set, not of history;
- `late_meta_idx` holds the non-first META events;
- `META_FIRST` is maintained on insert, including recovery's out-of-order inserts.

**`fork_asof_hop(e, const ViewCap *c, uint64 B_k, uint32_t *nb)`** (`:5712`):
- **Fast path**, when `c->seq == ∞` or `max_meta_seq ≤ c->seq` and no PAGE GROW sits in the inherited range with `seq > c->seq`. For the latter, a per-fork `max_inherited_page_seq` is kept; it is also a pure function of the present set. The visible set is then the tuple prefix `upper_bound(L, X)`.
- **Slow path.** Compute

  ```
  H = { META ∧ seq > S ∧ (¬META_FIRST ∨ lsn ≤ B_k) }
    ∪ { UNSTAMPED ∧ seq > S }
    ∪ { PAGE-GROW ∧ seq > S ∧ lsn ≤ B_k }
  ```

  (all with `lsn ≤ L`) and fold from `min(H)−1`, skipping H. The `X` bound applies at `lsn == L` as today.
- The same predicate is used by `fork_inheritance_fenced`, `fork_page_invalidated` and `fork_block_death_through`.
- `fork_nblocks_recovery` and `fork_newest_visible_lsn_through` stay LSN-only.

**PAGE-class GROW dedup is removed (rev 3; 4100849461/4100994214/4100994236).**
- Three findings in a row (4100849461, 4100994214, 4100994236) came from skipping a PAGE GROW because the hop fold at `(p, g)` already covered it. That fold includes META events that some view may hide. Whether the skip is safe then depends on which views exist, and on recovery restoring them before page replay.
- Rev 3 records **every** PAGE-class GROW:
  - `fork_event_add()` (`:6096-6098`) no longer drops a `FEV_GROW` whose hop size already covers it, for PAGE-class GROWs. Exact-identity duplicates (same `(lsn, seq)`, as in `fork_restore_later_page_growth` `:7058-7117`) are still collapsed; that is identity, not state.
  - `append_page_impl`: the persisted marker for ordered records is always `FEV_SEG_GROW(_BOUND)`, never `FEV_SEG_COMMIT(_BOUND)` for new records.

**Dependents of the old dedup, re-audited:**

| Dependent | Treatment |
|---|---|
| **Below-cutoff admission check** (`(ordered_record \|\| segment_grows) && !fork_meta_mutation_future(...)`, `:17103`) | Kept as a *view-independent* admission rule under a new name, `extends_uncapped = fork_size_asof_hop(fe, lsn, seq, ∞) < block+1`. A non-ordered page write below the cutoff is still admitted when it does not extend the uncapped size (honest late evictions of old pages keep working), and its GROW is recorded in memory. Its durability is the page record itself: replay re-derives it. The next cutover plans it under every fence mask (§3.7). |
| **Commit-class orphan adoption** (`fork_event_commit_adoptable`, `:6300-6320`; F2/F3 history) | Applies only to legacy `SEG_COMMIT*` markers. New records are growth-class, whose adoption rule is already proven sound unconditionally (MVP_COMPLETION_PLAN rev-3 row of 2026-09-19). Tests `test_orphaned_commit_marker_*` stay as legacy-format tests. |
| **F5 scaling guard** (`test_fork_event_index_scaling`) | The FSM/VM rewrite pattern now produces GROW events instead of inert commit markers. The guard's step bounds stay (lookups are still bisected). Add a memory-bound assertion after a cutover (below). |
| **`fev_bench.c`** | Re-baseline. |
| **ZEROEXTEND persist-skip** (`fork_grow_with_seq`, `:6966`) | This is a **META** GROW, and it is kept. It is view-independent: a skipped ZEROEXTEND equals a hidden one, which is crash-equivalent (unlogged growth). It never makes a page readable beyond `nblocks`, because pages carry their own PAGE GROWs. |
| **`fork_has_growth_at`** (markerless SEG0) | Reads only; unaffected. |

**Cost:**
- **Memory.** One 40 B `ForkEvent` per non-extending page write (formerly deduped) until the next forkmeta cutover.
- **Durable bytes.** Plain records add 0, since the segment record is the durability. Ordered records write `SEG_GROW` instead of `SEG_COMMIT`, which is the same size. Forkmeta snapshots grow only by the GROWs the plan retains.
- **Restart.** Each retained page version re-derives one GROW, bounded by retained versions, until the next cutover.

**Can consecutive GROWs be merged?**
- **Not locally.** Dropping `e1 = GROW(n1)@(p1,s1)` because a later `e2` exists changes the fold for every cap with `p1 ≤ L < p2`, or with `p1 == p2` and `X ∈ [s1, s2)`, or with `S ∈ [s1, s2)` in the inherited range. Future caps are unknown.
- **Only the forkmeta planner** may drop GROWs. It knows the live fence set, the floor, and the cutoff horizon. It keeps exactly what every mask's `retain_horizon` needs (§3.7(3)).
- **In-memory compaction.** After a successful cutover publish, extend `fork_event_compact_dropped_markers` to drop the plain PAGE-class GROWs at or below the cutoff that the published plan dropped. This needs no ordering argument beyond the planner's own:
  - later-created views have `L ≥` the page frontier ≥ the cutoff (CREATE_BRANCH and pin SET reject L below the page frontier, `branch_frontiers_allow`; the cutoff is ≤ every owner's page frontier, `fork_meta_snapshot_cutoff` `:9482`), so they see the collapsed region only through the retained cutoff-horizon fold;
  - GROWs re-derived by a later replay are fold-neutral for every live fence, because the plan proved them droppable.
- **Estimate.** ≤ 40 B × non-extending writes between cutovers. For example, 10k writes/s with a 60 s cadence is ≤ 24 MB.

### 3.3 Artifacts and control

- `artifact_visible()` (`pagestore_artifact_lifecycle.inc:93-136`) selects COMMIT/DROP with `page_select`. A same-C re-publication after DROP is a same-position rewrite (U4).
- Control restore selects the image and note independently. P5 adds a debug check that the redo values match.
- Clients:
  - WAL-owner/materializer control restore sends its pin `(R, seq)`;
  - the artifact producer reads with `(C, token)`.
- Not introduced: `control_pair_follow_promotion`, the lock-through-publication scheme, and the #294 collision walks.

### 3.4 WAL index

- `walidx_get()` stays LSN-capped.
- `PS_OP_BLOCK_DEATH` maps `(req_lsn, req_seq)` to a ViewCap.
- `walidx_plan_bases_build()` uses the new page planner and `fork_asof_hop` with the horizon or pin cap (`:15282,15296,15356`).
- `walidx_prune_fences()` returns ViewCaps.

### 3.5 Retention: pages; the registration gate

**Planner** (`ps_page_prune_plan`, `pagestore_prune.c:7-78`). Add an in-memory `PsViewFence { lsn, seq, strict_seq, inherited_below }`. The keep set is:
1. the floor base and the future tail, as today;
2. each fence's selection under §1.3 (one version);
3. **position closure.** At every position `p` where (1) or (2) keeps a version and `p > inherited_below` and `p ≤ L_f` for some finite-S fence, also keep the min-seq version at `p`;
4. **`prune_version_needed()`** (`:18426-18460`), per fence ViewCap with the §3.2 hidden-event predicate, may drop a fork-invalidated kept version, **but never one required by (3)**. Invalidation hides bytes; it does not erase the first-arrival fact (4100849491 example).

Closure depends on the *current* fence set, which is inherent to fence-driven retention. It is safe because:
- a view registered later has `S' ≥` every existing seq, so it never uses the escape at an existing position;
- every finite-S read is registered (below).

**Also changed:**
- `page_prune_fences()` (`:18721`) and `retention_project_cap()` (`:18166`) use §1.2.
- Descendant caps carry `branch_seq` (∞ for legacy).

**Ordered-path fence bump** (`:17040-17075`): positional fences are LSN-strict, so the write always lands at `> L`. STRICT pins keep the tuple test.

**Registration gate** (rev 3; 4100994214). `page_frontier_allows()` (`:4650`) and `…_structural/projected_fence_active()` (`:4620`, `:4568`):
- A level read with **finite composed S or X is honoured only if its full cap `(level, L, S, X)` equals a registered view's composed cap** (rev 6; 4100994214, 4101176465):
  - a live descendant's projected `(L, S, ∞)`;
  - a projected pin `(L, S, X)`, where X is the pin's own `S_r` if unprojected and ∞ if projected;
  - a WAL-index horizon `(H, S_H, ∞)` or a WAL_INDEX pin;
  - an artifact fence cap.

  An unregistered STRICT read can no longer borrow a positional branch registration with the same `(L, S)`, because X differs. A STRICT read must be matched by its own registered pin.
- **Otherwise it gets -2**, whatever `F.seq` is. Rev 2 allowed unregistered reads with `S ≥ F.seq`; that is removed (§9.1).
- Seq-less reads (`S = X = ∞`) and **`legacy` caps** (every constituent view predates its kind's activation, §2.2) are not gated. They keep today's frontier behaviour. The exemption is keyed on the epoch, not on the shape of the cap. A composed cap is `legacy` only if *all* its constituent views are. For example, a legacy pin read through a post-activation branch edge has a finite S, is not legacy, and is matched against the projected registrations as usual.
- Consequence: exact-R and advancing readers must hold a retention pin at `(R, S)` before issuing capped reads. That pin is obtained atomically, by RESERVE or by hand-off (§2.3). A `(R, S)` is never registered after the fact.

### 3.6 Retention: control

- `control_prune_fences()` emits ViewCaps, including each artifact cap.
- `control_chain_plan()` uses the positional planner plus closure. The twin lookup (`:18329-18334`) uses the fence-selected twin.
- `control_chain_keeps()` (`:18369-18412`) keeps each fence's selected note copy and the min-seq copy at each retained, escape-eligible LSN (closure), not only the newest copy per LSN.

### 3.7 Retention: forkmeta (highest risk)

1. **Per-fence admissibility masks** (§1.3, including PAGE GROWs in the inherited range) feed `retain_horizon`.
2. **Closure.** A retained META at an escape-eligible `p` implies retaining `META_FIRST` at `p`. A hidden UNSTAMPED event is retained whenever a later event at its LSN is retained.
3. **GROW retention.** `retain_horizon` over each mask keeps the largest admissible PAGE GROW after that mask's latest visible definitive event. This is the only GROW-dropping mechanism (§3.2), and property tests assert it.
4. **Fence filter** (`:9990-9998`): keep positional fences at `cutoff_lsn`.
5. **Derived fences.** Add `(cutoff_lsn, S, strict = cutoff_seq)` for every view with `L ≥ cutoff_lsn` and `S < cutoff_seq`.
6. **WAL-index horizons** become ViewCaps.
7. **Plan-epoch validation (U3), moved into P2 as a prerequisite of any activation.**
   - Keep a per-timeline `fork_event_admit_seq`: the max seq of any fork event or PAGE GROW admitted at `lsn ≤` the plan's max horizon. It is updated under the key's shard lock on admission.
   - The planner records the value at plan time.
   - **Final comparison and switch run under admission-wr** (rev 8; 4101315045). `walidx_publish` alone does not exclude fork or PAGE-GROW admissions, which hold only admission-rd plus a shard lock.
   - **WAL-index snapshot publication is split into three phases:**
     - **(A) Prepare, without admission.** Plan, under `walidx_prune_lock` (rd) and map (rd) as today. Write the new generation's payload and its manifest as *pending* (not yet referenced) files, fsync them, **and fsync the directory**, so every newly created name is durable before the switch (round 7, 4101392050). These are the heavy writes.
     - **(B) Switch, under admission-wr.** Take `admission-wr → walidx_publish (wr)`. This follows the global order admission → shard → page_prune → walidx_prune → map → walidx_publish → wal_lock → walidx_meta; no shard or prune locks are needed in (B). Compare `fork_event_admit_seq` with the plan's value. On mismatch, release both locks, discard the pending files and re-plan. On a match, `rename()` the pending manifest over the current one and switch the in-memory generation. Release.
       - (B) contains no fsync, only one `rename` plus pointer updates, so all admissions stall for microseconds. This is comparable to the existing barrier.
     - **(C) Durability, after (B).** fsync the directory to make the rename durable, then publish the WAL-index frontier and retire the sources in the existing order. Source retirement waits for (C).
       - A **process** crash after the rename sees the new manifest, since the rename is visible immediately. A **power loss** before the directory fsync may see either manifest.
       - Recovery therefore **accepts and validates either** manifest. Both are complete and durable because of (A), and the sources are still intact because retirement waits for (C).
       - The plan-epoch check is not needed at recovery. If the new generation won, it was switched under admission-wr with a matching epoch; if the old one won, it is the pre-switch state.
   - **Forkmeta cutover.** It already takes admission-wr for `freeze_seq` (`:10575`). Its epoch comparison moves inside that same section, immediately before its switch. The same prepare/switch split applies if its switch currently fsyncs under admission-wr.
8. **Restart.** `META_FIRST`, `max_meta_seq` and `max_inherited_page_seq` are recomputed from the retained events. Closure makes `META_FIRST` identical, and the other two are functions of the present set.

### 3.8 Persistence of admission_seq

- Global and monotonic (`:353`, `:918`, `:934`).
- Observed from segments/layers, forkmeta, the cutoff and retention. `branch_seq`, `S_H` and `activation_seq` are added.
- **Sentinel-safe observe (rev 7; 4101247324).**
  - `admission_seq_observe(UINT64_MAX)` today sets `next_admission_seq = UINT64_MAX` (`:934-944`). `admission_seq_alloc()` then returns 0 forever (`:918-931`), and every admission fails.
  - A real record can never carry `UINT64_MAX`, because allocation stops at `UINT64_MAX - 1`.
  - So: (1) every new observe source goes through `admission_seq_observe_finite(v)`, which skips `v == 0` (legacy) and `v == PS_SEQ_UNBOUNDED`; (2) `admission_seq_observe()` itself ignores `UINT64_MAX` and logs it as corrupt input, as defence in depth.
  - New sources: `branch_seq` (∞ written by P3a, legacy creates), `S_H` (∞ written by P3a, legacy progress), `activation_seq` (always finite; asserted nonzero and not ∞ when written and replayed).
- **Sentinel audit.** Places where a sentinel is persisted or observed:

  | Value | Where | Status |
  |---|---|---|
  | `PS_SEQ_UNBOUNDED` (= `UINT64_MAX`) | V3 `branch_seq`, WIPG v2 / WISD v4 `horizon_seq` | Persisted, skipped by observe. Covered. |
  | `UINT64_MAX` as a "bare LSN fence" seq in `PsPruneFence` (`page_prune_fences` `:18764-18774`, pin projection `:18745-18747`) | In memory only. `page_frontier_advance` persists only `next_admission_seq - 1`, which is finite. | P1 asserts that `page_frontier_advance`, the forkmeta cutoff persist and the retention log never receive `UINT64_MAX` as a seq. |
  | `fork_meta_snapshot_cutoff_seq` | Persisted in FMS and observed at `:10574` | Derived from owner frontiers or `(branch_lsn, 1)`, so finite today. Now routed through `observe_finite` and asserted. |
  | `0` (legacy seq / "uncapped" `seq_cap`) | Records, layers, forkmeta | Observe of 0 is harmless. P1 forbids passing 0 as a *cap* into the new ViewCap API: request `req_seq == 0` is converted to ∞ at the boundary, so "legacy record seq 0" and "no cap" can never be confused. |
  | `hdr.lsn == UINT64_MAX` | The ordered-path bump (`:17060-17066`) | Already refused. |
  | `ch->result` newly-created flag, `R2_PROVEN` magic | Wire only | Never persisted. |
- Preserved through flush, compaction (`:2973`, `:3599`) and forkmeta.
- Nothing rewrites a stored seq; P1 asserts identity preservation in the merge.

---

## 4. Persisted formats (all land in P3a, before any activation; §9)

### 4.1 Timeline log `TimelineRecEventV3` (rec_len 64)

```
{ magic TLM2, rec_len, kind, id, parent, state, branch_lsn, incarnation,
  parent_incarnation, branch_seq, crc, reserved }
```

- CREATE and STATE carry `branch_seq`; replay validates equality and observes it **only if finite** (§3.8). A P3a binary always writes `PS_SEQ_UNBOUNDED` (§2.2).
- New event kind `TIMELINE_META_EVENT_CAP_ACTIVATION {kind, activation_seq}` (§2.2). It is defined and fail-closed-parsed in P3a, and written by P3b/P5.
- Legacy creates map to ∞.
- Identity `timelines` goes from 2 to 3.
- Old binaries reject `rec_len = 64`.

**Legacy rule: S = ∞ is bit-for-bit today's behaviour**: `page_select` = `page_visible(…,0)`, an empty hidden set, the positional fence `(L, ∞)` equal to today's keep rule, closure inactive, and no registration needed because the read is seq-less at that edge. A new descendant of a legacy branch freezes its whole ancestry through min-composition.

**Fixtures (D5 rule 2):** demote `posix-timeline-delete-holes` to legacy (byte-identical) and add a current V3 fixture (branch + post-fork rewrite) with a frozen-view reopen oracle.

### 4.2 Forkmeta V4 / FMS v2

- `FORK_META_V4_MAGIC`, the V3 layout; `kind` flags `0x40` META (ZEROEXTEND GROW) and `0x80` UNSTAMPED.
- Legacy V2/V3: SET/DEAD are META; a plain `FEV_GROW` is PAGE.
- The FMS payload goes from v1 to v2 with the flags.
- Identities and fixtures: demote `posix-forkmeta-crc`.
- **These must be written from P3a on, before P3b activates finite caps.** Otherwise a META GROW written in the V3 shape reloads as PAGE and becomes unconditionally visible (4100994233).

### 4.3 WAL-index progress

WIPG v2 `horizon_seq`, WISD v4. Legacy is ∞, and a P3a binary writes ∞ (§2.2). Identity plus fixture.

### 4.4 Unchanged

Page segments, image layers, frontier files, the retention log, artifact formats, control blocks, and the materializer marker.

---

## 5. Unstamped and synthetic-label fork events

### 5.1 Daemon side

- `req_lsn == 0` is placed at `max(fork_op_lsn(), req_floor_lsn)` (`:20139`; `req_floor_lsn` is a new `PsChannel` field, 0 for legacy clients). **The struct change bumps `PS_SHM_VERSION` in P3a**, in the same phase as the field (round 7, 4101392030), so mismatched layouts refuse to attach. P4 needs no further bump: every daemon at that version already honours the field.
- It is persisted `UNSTAMPED`, with seq-only visibility (§1.6).
- The ordered page path is unchanged except for the LSN-strict bump.

### 5.2 Client side: WAL-less CREATE/TRUNCATE/ZEROEXTEND

**P0 `+1` (mitigation).**
- `GetXLogInsertRecPtr() + 1` (the replay pointer + 1 in recovery) is strictly above every existing cut. Record ends are MAXALIGNed, so it never collides with a real record end.
- **Cost:** a pre-fork WAL-less op while WAL is idle is invisible to a cut at that idle position. That affects only unlogged relations, which are reset at branch boot.

**P4 (precise).**
- The client sends `req_lsn = 0` together with `req_floor_lsn = insert + 1`.
- Bare `req_lsn = 0` is insufficient: `newest_visible + 1` can lie far below the op's real time, so a *later* view at a past `L'` would see it.
- In the same P4 commit, `ls_op_lsn()`'s `+1` and `ls_zeroextend`'s insert stamp (`backend_localsvc.c:977-996`) are removed, with no further `PS_SHM_VERSION` bump. The field and its daemon-side handling landed with the P3a bump. The format (the UNSTAMPED flag) is already in place from P3a.

### 5.3 Equality at the cut for other label sources

| Source | Conclusion |
|---|---|
| UNLINK at transaction end (this transaction's commit/abort record end) | Equality is the correct inclusion. **No edge.** |
| Control images from WAL-driven updates (record end, clamped to `minRecoveryPoint`) | **No edge.** |
| Control images from record-less transitions (`DB_SHUTDOWNING` `xlog.c:7654`, promotion `:6818-6820`) | The edge exists but is **benign**: only `state` differs, and restore does not trust it (`pagestore_control_restore.c:688-715`). P5 asserts this. |
| SLRU live mirror (`pagestore_slru.c:3514`, the insert pointer) | **Benign.** It captures WAL-driven state. pg_subtrans must not be mirrored (P5 audit). |
| SLRU seeds / reader snapshots at C | **No edge.** |
| Relation pages | **No edge.** |

---

## 6. Compatibility with the parts of #294 that are kept

### 6.1 P0 (PR #296)

- UNLINK keeps the transaction end.
- CREATE/TRUNCATE without their own WAL use insert + 1 (replay + 1 in recovery).
- The startup process uses the replay pointer.
- P4 replaces the `+1`.

### 6.2 Acceptance suites

**Kept from #294:** `fork_newest_definitive_event_through()` as the CREATE-retry idempotence check (lands in P3b). Without it, ancestry-3 fails because of a pre-existing parent-side bug.

**`run_bugb_suite`:** every check holds as analysed in rev 2: rel100 first arrival, rel101/105 non-first META, rel102 UNSTAMPED, rel103 pre-S, rel104, rel106 LSN-strict bump, and the control check. Adjustments:
- the pinned reader at 1200 passes its pin seq; it holds a pin, so it is registered;
- add parent newest checks (rel103=0x30, control=0x77, rel101/102 at 3 blocks, rel105 truncated).

**Revision suite:**
- 1 holds (it reads with `pin_seq` and the pin is registered);
- 2: adjust to send the MATERIALIZER pin seq;
- 3 and 4 hold.

**Ancestry suite:**
- 1 and 2 hold via §1.5;
- 3 holds via the kept idempotence check;
- 4 holds;
- 5: pass the pin seq.

**Replaced:** `test_promoted_control_collision_follows_its_pair`. The note and image stay at 2000; the fence with `S_a` selects the pre-rewrite copy; `wal_floor == 1800`. The cutover round-3 rejection holds.

---

## 7. Audit items

| Item | Resolution |
|---|---|
| V1, V2/V3, V4, V5, V6, V7, G1, G2 | By construction (no promotion; local inherited range; untouched parent order; closure preserves first-status). |
| U1 | Needs work (P5): WAL-index caps and planner. |
| U2 | By construction, with a semantic change: pins are positional below R, and at R `seq ≤ X` with the escape kept. |
| U3 | Plan-epoch validation, **in P2** (§3.7(7)). |
| U4 | By construction (§2.1). |
| U5 | Out of scope, guarded by an assert. |
| Stale/synthetic label at a fresh position | P0 `+1`, then P4 (§5.2); other sources in §5.3. |
| **G3** | Closed by the requirement below. |

### G3 requirement (rev 5: the controller flow only)

**What must hold.**
- **(G3-i)** No version with `pd_lsn ≤ L` admitted before S carries a hint about a transaction that commits after L.
- **(G3-ii)** Every position `≤ L` that can later receive post-L hints already has a pre-S version, so any later rewrite is a same-position rewrite and is hidden (§1.3).

**Why a live-parent proof is not possible (rev 4's R1 is removed; 4101119417).**
- A buffer that is already `BM_DIRTY` when checkpoint C starts takes the fast path in `MarkSharedBufferDirtyHint` (`bufmgr.c:5769-5830`) and emits **no FPI**, even with `wal_log_hints`. A post-L hint can therefore be written while `pd_lsn` is still `≤ L`.
- The same applies to other unlogged page changes, such as index `LP_DEAD` marks.
- A read-side scrub would have to understand every AM's unlogged bits, so it is rejected.
- **In production, a branch can therefore be created only through the controller flow, proven by R2 below.** R1 and everything that belonged to it (the `wal_log_hints` requirement, the lifetime floor, the `control_file_write_hook` use) are deleted.

#### The controller flow (verified in rev 4)

`pagestore_branch_prepare.py` `execute()` (`:1572-1650`) runs these steps in order:
1. `stop_writer` (`:1162`): `pg_ctl -m fast stop`, which writes a **shutdown checkpoint C**.
2. `start_restricted_writer` (`:1168-1202`): private socket, `autovacuum=off`.
3. `select_checkpoint` (`:1204`).
4. `archive_checkpoint` (`:1226`, `pg_switch_wal`).
5. `wait_materializer` and `pause_and_capture` (`:1291`, `:1131`): a materializer restartpoint; `L` is the segment boundary after the switch.
6. `prepare_branch` (`:1304`): `pagestore_prepare_branch_from_control` on the restricted writer, which issues CREATE_BRANCH and so samples S.
7. `success_restore`: resume the materializer and restore the normal writer (`:1358-1375`).

#### R2: the proof, checked inside `pagestore_prepare_branch_from_control` (`pagestore.c:13664`)

- **(R2-s) C is a shutdown checkpoint.**
  - `ps_checkpoint_record_end()` (`pagestore.c:3806`) already reads C's record from WAL and accepts `XLOG_CHECKPOINT_ONLINE | XLOG_CHECKPOINT_SHUTDOWN`. It gains an out-parameter for the info code.
  - `pagestore_branch_horizons_from_control()` (`:13261`) exports it in `PagestoreBranchHorizons`.
  - The entry point requires `info == XLOG_CHECKPOINT_SHUTDOWN` and `checkPointCopy.redo == checkpoint record LSN`, which is true of every shutdown checkpoint.
  - A shutdown checkpoint means there is no running transaction at C: fast shutdown aborts every backend transaction before the checkpoint. Only prepared transactions survive a shutdown.
- **(R2-x) No transaction commits or finishes a prepared transaction after L, before S** (rev 6; 4101119428, 4101176475).
  - **Why this is the right window.** Commits at or before L are part of the branch's history, since the branch replays WAL to L. Hints about them are correct for the branch. The danger is a transaction whose commit, commit-prepared or abort-prepared record lies after L, while a hint about it can reach a pre-S page version. For example, a COMMIT PREPARED issued before any check leaves no prepared transaction behind and assigns no new XID, which defeats the rev-5 checks.
  - **Why connection restrictions are not a proof.** The restricted writer's private socket and `autovacuum=off` exclude client sessions and autovacuum. They do **not** exclude background workers registered by `shared_preload_libraries` (for example pg_cron, or the pagestore workers that are not disabled), which connect internally without the socket. So "the first statement sees no prepared transactions" cannot be established from connection policy.
  - **Authoritative check: a WAL scan in the server entry point.** After CREATE_BRANCH returns, the entry point takes `P = GetXLogInsertRecPtr()` and calls `XLogFlush(P)`. It then reads the parent's local WAL from `L` to `P` with the same XLogReader machinery that `ps_checkpoint_record_end()` (`pagestore.c:3806`) uses.
    - It rejects any `RM_XACT_ID` record with info `XLOG_XACT_COMMIT`, `XLOG_XACT_COMMIT_PREPARED` or `XLOG_XACT_ABORT_PREPARED`.
    - Plain `XLOG_XACT_ABORT` is allowed. That XID is in progress at L for the branch, so the branch aborts it too, and an "invalid" hint is consistent.
    - Every commit before S has its record before the insert position at S, which is `≤ P`. So the scan covers `(L, S]`.
    - `L` is a WAL segment boundary after `pg_switch_wal()` (controller step 5), so no record spans it.
    - The scan covers only the restricted window: one segment's worth plus whatever the window wrote.
  - **Early checks (fail fast, not the proof).** The existing `nextXid == checkPointCopy.nextXid` and `pg_prepared_xacts` empty checks stay as pre-checks.
  - **Ordering in the controller.** They move to a new SQL function, `pagestore_branch_window_open(checkpoint_redo)`. `execute()` calls it as **the first statement on the restricted writer after the read-only isolation health check inside** `start_restricted_writer()` (`pagestore_branch_prepare.py:1168-1202`) and before `select_checkpoint()` (`:1204`). Its result (nextXid, prepared count) is recorded in the journal (`window_opened`). `pagestore_prepare_branch_from_control` repeats both checks as its pre-check and fails if they differ from the journaled snapshot, which the controller passes as an argument. These only give earlier, clearer errors: correctness rests on the WAL scan.
  - Together with R2-s (no running transactions at C) and R2-m, the scan proves G3-i with no assumption about who can connect.
- **(R2-m) Everything at or below L is materialized before S.** The store-observed materializer marker (`pagestore_materializer_status()`, `pagestore.c:2184`) must be `≥ L`, checked before CREATE_BRANCH.
  - Today `fork ≤ materialized` is checked only when the caller is the materializer (`:13697-13710`).
  - The restartpoint flushed every page state with `pd_lsn ≤ L`, so every position `≤ L` has a pre-S version.
  - Post-S hint-only rewrites, by the normal writer after `restore_writer` or by the resumed materializer, are therefore hidden same-position rewrites, whatever the hint-WAL setting. **(Proves G3-ii.)**
- The controller's own statements after `stop_writer` (`pagestore_branch_window_open`, `pagestore_branch_checkpoint()`, `pg_switch_wal()`, `pagestore_shipped_wal_lsn()`, `SET`, the prepare call) must not commit XID-assigning transactions after L. P3b verifies this on the mvp_golden run; the WAL scan enforces it.

#### Post-check failure and exact retries (4101119435)

**Detecting "newly created".** CREATE_BRANCH currently returns the same incarnation for a first creation and for an exact retry. For example, target incarnation 0 or 1 on a fresh id yields 1 on both paths (`pagestore_core.c` CREATE_BRANCH handler `:20598-20640`). So the incarnation cannot express "created by this call".

- The daemon reports two bits in `ch->result`:
  - `PS_BRANCH_RESULT_NEW` (bit 0), set only on the path that actually persists a new create record (`timeline_persist_create()` succeeded). The exact-retry `break` leaves it clear.
  - `PS_BRANCH_RESULT_FINITE` (bit 1), set iff the persisted `branch_seq` is finite.
- **The safe controller path refuses ∞** (round 7, 4101392035). If CREATE_BRANCH returns without `FINITE`, which can only be an exact retry of a branch created by a P3a binary or an unsafe direct caller, `pagestore_prepare_branch_from_control` does **not** publish readiness:
  - Under the controller, a timeline of its own journaled incarnation before `branch_prepared` goes to `r2_cleanup`, and the operator reruns with a new incarnation.
  - Otherwise the call errors with `pagestore branch %u incarnation %llu is uncapped (created without safe caps); it cannot be prepared by the safe controller`.
- `ch->result` is already reset to 0 by the daemon before every request (`pagestore_daemon.c:414`) and is otherwise unused for this opcode.
- **No struct or wire change.** An older daemon always returns 0, which the new client treats as "not newly created" and so never deletes: fail-closed.
- The new meaning is recorded in the `PS_SHM_VERSION` history comment (`pagestore_ipc.h`). A version bump is not required for safety.
- `pagestore_localsvc_create_branch()` (`backend_localsvc.c:1496-1512`) returns the flag.

**Rules inside `pagestore_prepare_branch_from_control`** (ordering: R2 pre-check → `prepare_branch_impl` (seeds SLRUs, SLRU manifest, CREATE_BRANCH) → R2 post-check → bootstrap readiness file, i.e. `PAGESTORE_BRANCH_BOOTSTRAP_FILE` written after the SLRU manifest):

1. **The readiness file already exists and matches** (the existing retry branch at `:13730`). An earlier call already passed R2, because the file is written only after a passing post-check. The retry skips R2 and is idempotent.
   - **The readiness file is the durable "validated" marker.** It is written and fsynced (file plus directory) by the same call, immediately after a passing WAL-scan post-check, and nowhere else.
   - Any call that finds no readiness file must redo the full post-check, including the WAL scan from L to the *current* insert position, before writing it. That covers a crash-recovery retry after a lost reply or a crash between CREATE_BRANCH and readiness.
   - If the writer was restored in the meantime, the scan finds commits and the call fails into `r2_cleanup`.
   - No separate marker is needed. The controller journal alone is not trusted as the proof, because the readiness file is what installers consume, and it is written only under a passed post-check.
2. **Pre-check fails**: error, nothing created.
3. **Post-check fails and this call newly created the timeline** (flag = 1). The readiness file was not written by this call. Cleanup runs **in this order**, each step idempotent (4101176481):
   1. Remove every prepared-directory artifact that could advertise the branch: the SLRU manifest and, defensively, any `PAGESTORE_BRANCH_BOOTSTRAP_FILE` or `pagestore_branch.manifest`. Then `fsync` the prepared directory.
   2. Only then issue BEGIN_DELETE for `(new_tl, new_incarnation)`, with the existing `pagestore_delete_branch` semantics.
   3. Raise the R2 error with SQLSTATE `55000`. Its DETAIL states `cleanup=complete`, or which step failed.
4. **Post-check fails and the timeline already existed** (flag = 0, e.g. an earlier call crashed between CREATE_BRANCH and its post-check).
   - **Do not delete.** A published branch manifest (the target installer's `pagestore_branch.manifest`) or any other consumer may reference the timeline, and this call cannot prove otherwise.
   - Fail closed: raise the error with the timeline id and incarnation. A caller without a journal (a direct SQL call) must delete it manually. The controller cleans it up under rule 5.
5. **The controller journal** (`pagestore_branch_prepare.py`).
   - Before the prepare call, the journal already records intent `prepare_branch` together with `new_tl` and `new_incarnation`. The controller owns that incarnation exclusively for this operation.
   - On an R2 error, **or** on any ambiguous outcome (a lost reply or a server crash inside the call), the controller writes state **`r2_cleanup`** and then performs the same two steps itself, in the same order:
     1. manifest and readiness artifacts removed and the directory fsynced (journal `r2_cleanup/manifest_removed`);
     2. `pagestore_delete_branch(new_tl, new_incarnation)` (journal `r2_cleanup/timeline_deleting`).
   - Then it writes `r2_failed`.
   - `recover_journal` resumes from whichever sub-state it finds, and never runs step 2 before step 1 is journaled.
   - The controller may delete a timeline that exists under its own `(new_tl, new_incarnation)` even when the flag is 0 (rule 4), **as long as the journal has not reached `branch_prepared`**. Before that point no installer can have published a manifest for it, because the target installer runs only after the prepared receipt.
   - After `r2_failed` an operator reruns with `new_incarnation + 1`.
   - `preserve_prepare_fence` (`:1686-1715`) keeps services fenced throughout.

#### Mixed-version gating for P3b (rev 7; 4101247321)

The compute-side R2 checks and the daemon-side finite `branch_seq` must be active together. Both mixed combinations must refuse or degrade safely.

- **Daemon capability.**
  - The shm header already has a daemon-published capability word, `PsShmHeader.frontend_capabilities` (`pagestore_ipc.h:578`, bits `PS_FRONTEND_CAP_*` at `:121-124`). The POSIX daemon sets it at `pagestore_daemon.c:1543`, and `pagestore_inspect.c:619` consumes it.
  - Add **`PS_FRONTEND_CAP_BRANCH_SEQ` = bit 1**, set by P3b daemons (POSIX, and the SPDK daemon when it gains P3b).
  - **No header layout change and no `PS_SHM_VERSION` bump.** Old daemons leave the bit clear. The bump is still recorded in the version history comment.
- **Request flag.**
  - CREATE_BRANCH carries `ch->is_redo = PS_CREATE_BRANCH_R2_PROVEN` (a 32-bit magic, `0x52325056`, "R2PV"). `is_redo` is unused by CREATE_BRANCH today.
  - Channel fields are **not** reset between requests (`ls_chan()`, `backend_localsvc.c:402-406`), so an old client can leave a stale `is_redo` of 0, 1 or 2 from a previous CREATE/UNLINK/TRUNCATE. The daemon therefore accepts only the exact magic. A plain boolean would be spoofed by stale values.
  - The new client always writes the field explicitly: the magic, or 0.
- **Daemon rule.** A **new** create persists a finite `branch_seq` iff the request carries the magic *and* `CAP_ACTIVATION{BRANCH}` exists. Otherwise it persists ∞.
  - **Exact retry of a branch whose persisted `branch_seq` is finite** (4101315034): accepted **only with the magic**. Otherwise the daemon refuses with `status = ERROR` and `result = PS_BRANCH_REFUSE_UNPROVEN_RETRY`, so an old client cannot continue a finite creation and publish readiness without R2.
  - The new client maps that refusal to `ERROR: pagestore branch %u incarnation %llu was created with safe caps; retrying it requires a client that performs the branch safety post-check`.
  - An exact retry of an ∞ branch is unaffected.
- **Client rule.**
  - `pagestore_prepare_branch_from_control` reads `frontend_capabilities` before the pre-check. If `PS_FRONTEND_CAP_BRANCH_SEQ` is clear, it **refuses**, before creating anything:

    ```
    ERROR:  pagestore daemon does not support safe branch caps
    DETAIL: The connected pagestore daemon lacks PS_FRONTEND_CAP_BRANCH_SEQ; a branch created now would not be frozen against post-fork parent admissions.
    HINT:   Upgrade the pagestore daemon before creating branches.
    ```

  - With the bit set, it sends the magic only after R2's pre-check has passed (R2-s, the early checks, R2-m). The post-check WAL scan then decides whether to keep or clean up the branch.
  - The direct entry points (unsafe GUC) send 0, so their branches are ∞. They carry no R2 proof, which is documented as legacy semantics.
- **Combinations:**

  | Client | Daemon | Result |
  |---|---|---|
  | new | old (bit clear) | refused by the client |
  | old | new (no magic) | ∞: exactly today's semantics. The old client also lacks the G3 gate, so nothing is weaker than today. |
  | new | new | finite S only with R2 |
- **Core and IPC tests** that exercise finite caps directly (`run_bugb_suite`, the ancestry and revision suites, the op fuzzer) set the magic themselves. The daemon cannot verify R2; the flag is the compute's assertion.
- **The flag does not affect `branch_seq` alone.** A daemon that writes finite `branch_seq` also enforces its reads and retention (the P3b activation). There is no state in which finite seqs are persisted but read as ∞.

#### Direct entry points (test-only)

- The direct entry points are `pagestore_create_branch` (`pagestore.c:1425`), `pagestore_create_branch_with_incarnation` (`:1446`), and the legacy `pagestore_prepare_branch` (the path at `:13535`, `:13567`).
- They refuse by default. They are allowed only when **`pagestore.allow_unsafe_branch_cut = on`**:
  - PGC_SUSET, `GUC_NOT_IN_SAMPLE | GUC_DISALLOW_IN_FILE`;
  - described as "UNSAFE, test only: permits branches without the G3 hint-bit proof";
  - each use logs a WARNING.
- `pagestore_prepare_branch_from_control` never honours the GUC. R2 is always enforced there.
- **G3 exposure in unsafe mode:** the branch may contain parent pages with `pd_lsn ≤ L` carrying hint bits (or `LP_DEAD` marks) about transactions that committed after L. A branch that reuses those XIDs can then see wrong tuple visibility. The mode is acceptable only for test data.

**Errors** (`ERRCODE_OBJECT_NOT_IN_PREREQUISITE_STATE`):
```
-- direct entry point, GUC off
ERROR:  pagestore branch creation outside the controller flow is disabled
DETAIL: Branches created without the shutdown-checkpoint proof may contain parent hint bits written after the branch point.
HINT:   Use pagestore_branch_prepare (pagestore_prepare_branch_from_control). For tests only, SET pagestore.allow_unsafe_branch_cut = on.

-- R2-s

```

#### Impact on existing tests and scripts

| Caller | Current use | Change |
|---|---|---|
| `mvp_golden_test.sh` (`:419`, `:501`) | the controller (`pagestore_branch_prepare`) | none, except that the verified no-XID property is asserted. The `:293` API-count query is unchanged. |
| `endurance/pagestore_endurance.py` (`:295`) | the controller | none |
| `integration_test.sh` `:742-762`, `:1253` | legacy `pagestore_prepare_branch` | prefix the session with `SET pagestore.allow_unsafe_branch_cut = on;` |
| `integration_test.sh` `:1317-1443` | `pagestore_prepare_branch_from_control` after an **online** `CHECKPOINT` (`:1317`) | replace `CHECKPOINT` with a fast stop and start of the writer (`pg_ctl -m fast restart`), then read `pg_control_checkpoint()`. With no XID-assigning statements until the prepare, this exercises R2-s/x/m for real. The negative cases `:1439` (`shortFork`) and `:1443` (`badAuto`) keep their expected errors. Add cases: an online checkpoint is rejected (R2-s); an XID assigned between the checkpoint and the prepare is rejected (R2-x). |
| `branch_boot_test.sh` `:123-144` | legacy `pagestore_prepare_branch` | `SET pagestore.allow_unsafe_branch_cut = on` |
| `harness/pagestore_harness.py` and the other core/IPC tests (`pagestore_test.c`, the op fuzzer) | the daemon's CREATE_BRANCH directly | unaffected: the gate and R2 are compute-side |

## 8. Test plan

### 8.1 Unit tests (core)

- **`page_select`:** pre-S; post-S first arrival; multiple post-S; the **strict boundary with the escape** (the §1.2 example: first arrival seq 15 visible under `(R,10,20)`, a second arrival seq 25 hidden); the inherited range; legacy; a differential at ∞.
- **Composition:** 3-level chains, legacy edges, and a brute-force check that `admissible(composed) == ∩ admissible(constituents)` over random caps and entries, including STRICT.
- **Fork fold:** extend `ps_test_fork_event_index_selftest` with META/PAGE/UNSTAMPED/inherited mixes against a literal §1.3 reference. Keep the F5 step guard and add a post-view-META variant.
- **GROW recording:**
  - every PAGE GROW is recorded (no size-based skip);
  - the grandchild case from 4100849461;
  - the unregistered-read case from 4100994214 is now rejected with -2;
  - the restart case from 4100994236: a live horizon, a post-horizon META, then a page extension; restart; the horizon read gives nblocks covering the page;
  - the below-cutoff honest late non-extending write is admitted and its GROW recorded;
  - memory is bounded after a cutover (in-memory compaction).
- **Artifact caps** (4100849476 scenario).
- **Inherited range** after an ancestor prune.

### 8.2 Planner property tests (merge blockers)

- For random histories, fences (positional/STRICT, random `B`), floor, invalidating events, cutoff and derived fences: `select(kept) == select(all)` and `fold(kept) == fold(all)` per fence, **and again after appending random future arrivals**.
- Named cases:
  - `(20,1)/(20,5)` under `S=3`;
  - post-S-only keeps the min;
  - a fence above P;
  - collectable after release;
  - **an invalidated first arrival still defines `s_min`**;
  - control-note closure;
  - forkmeta closure;
  - GROW retention under hiding masks;
  - **plan-epoch abort**: an admission between plan and publish forces a re-plan.

### 8.3 Crash / restart

- **`branch_seq`:** persistence, the retry/reuse cases, and the **observe regression**.
- Legacy reopen as ∞.
- V4 flags, and identical `META_FIRST` after reopen.
- `S_H`.
- Artifact caps from completion records.
- **G3 retry semantics:** crash between CREATE_BRANCH and the post-check, then retry: the flag is 0 and the branch is not deleted (fail closed). Crash after the readiness file: the retry is idempotent with no R2 re-check.
- Fault points on the V3 appends.

### 8.4 Compaction / prune integration

- The frozen view survives compaction, cutover and walidx snapshot.
- Pre-S versions are reclaimed after release (soak).
- The registration gate.

### 8.5 Op fuzzer

- `ship_wal()` returns the **end** LSN; the workaround is retired.
- The oracle reads the **branch**.
- New actions:
  - hint rewrite;
  - delayed honest write;
  - stale META;
  - unstamped META with and without floor;
  - grandchild and child-local `p ≤ B`;
  - control same-version rewrite;
  - artifact fail/retry;
  - explicit compaction/cutover;
  - pin-on-branch strict boundary;
  - **re-verify every frozen view after every prune and restart**.
- Default seed plus 20 seeds.

### 8.5a G3 checks

- **Direct entry points:** refused with the GUC off; allowed with a WARNING with it on; `prepare_branch_from_control` ignores the GUC.
- **R2-s:** an online checkpoint is rejected; a shutdown checkpoint is accepted.
- **R2-x:**
  - a COMMIT PREPARED issued by a background worker (test bgworker) after L and before the pre-check is rejected by the WAL scan (4101176475);
  - a commit during CREATE_BRANCH (fault hook) is rejected by the WAL scan;
  - a plain abort after L is accepted;
  - a commit between C and L is accepted;
  - a nextXid or prepared-count mismatch against the journaled `window_opened` snapshot gives the early error.
- **Cleanup order:** crash injected between the two cleanup steps. Recovery finds the manifest gone and the timeline still LIVE, then deletes it. There is never a LIVE manifest pointing at a DELETED timeline, and never a deleted timeline with the manifest present.
- **Full-cap gate:** an unregistered STRICT read with the same `(L, S)` as a branch gets -2.
- **Sentinel restart regression:** create a P3a-style branch with `branch_seq = ∞` and a WIPG v2 record with `S_H = ∞`; restart. `next_admission_seq` must be a small finite value and page and fork admissions must succeed. Also a unit test that `admission_seq_observe(UINT64_MAX)` is ignored.
- **Legacy strict reads:** a pre-activation exact-R read without a pin still returns today's result, including the §1d tuple fence at R (a post-pin rewrite at R stays hidden) and is not gated. A post-activation unpinned strict read gets -2.
- **Unproven retry:** an exact retry of a finite branch without the magic is refused (`PS_BRANCH_REFUSE_UNPROVEN_RETRY`). A retry after a crash between CREATE_BRANCH and readiness redoes the WAL scan before writing readiness; with the writer restored in between, it fails into `r2_cleanup`.
- **Atomic pins (§2.3):** a barrier with `PS_BARRIER_REGISTER` leaves a `CHECKPOINT_FENCE` pin. Hand-off PIN_SET at its `(R, S)` succeeds. An explicit-seq SET with no identical live registration gets `PS_RETENTION_NOT_REGISTERED`. A prune racing the hand-off (fault hook between them) cannot drop the pre-S version. Fence pins beyond the newest two are released.
- **WAL-index publish:** an admission injected between (A) and (B) forces a re-plan. A crash between the rename and the directory fsync recovers either generation (both validated), with sources intact. Tests accept both outcomes. An admission-latency measurement for (B) is recorded in the PR.
- **Mixed versions (P3b):** a new client with an old daemon (capability bit clear) refuses with the error. An old client with a new daemon (no magic) gets ∞ and legacy behaviour. A stale `is_redo` value of 1 or 2 left in the channel does not count as `R2_PROVEN`.
- **Activation epochs:** a pin, horizon or artifact fence created before activation still reads today's result after activation plus compaction; one created after activation is frozen. A branch created by a P3a binary stays ∞ after the upgrade to P3b. A P3a binary refuses a store that has a `CAP_ACTIVATION` record.
- **R2-m:** a materializer marker below the fork is rejected.
- **Newly created flag:** 1 on first creation, 0 on an exact retry, 0 from an old daemon (so no deletion).
- **Rule 4:** after a direct SQL call, a pre-existing timeline plus a post-check failure is not deleted, and the error names it. Under the controller, a timeline of the journal's own incarnation, before `branch_prepared`, is cleaned up through `r2_cleanup`.
- **End to end** (controller harness): after `restore_writer`, run post-L commits and hint-setting scans on the parent. The branch pages keep their pre-S bytes, with `wal_log_hints` off and on.

### 8.6 System

`integration_test.sh`, `mvp_golden_test.sh` (redo cuts or overrides), `branch_boot_test.sh`, and an endurance run (note E-6).

## 9. Phases, sizes and risks

**Rule:** every persisted-format bump lands before the activation that depends on it, and no activation spans a format change.

| Phase | Content | Code + tests |
|---|---|---|
| **P0** | `ls_op_lsn()` `+1` fallback (PR #296) | ~60 + 0 |
| **P1** | Refactor, no behaviour change. ViewCap and composition (STRICT-exact), `TlWalk` + `B_k`, `page_select`, identity lookups, ForkEvent flags and indexes, the fold slow path, I-ALLOC/U5 asserts. All caps ∞. | ~750 + ~600 (detail in §9.3) |
| **P2** | Planner. `PsViewFence`, positional/STRICT modes, closure (page/control/forkmeta), the invalidation exception, masks, derived fences, the LSN-strict ordered bump, **U3 plan-epoch validation, with the WAL-index publish split into prepare / switch-under-admission-wr / durable (§3.7(7))**, property tests. | ~900 + ~900 |
| **P3a** | Formats, no activation. `TimelineRecEventV3` (**writes `branch_seq = ∞`**; the `CAP_ACTIVATION` kind is defined and fail-closed); forkmeta V4 / FMS v2 (META/UNSTAMPED flags written); WIPG v2 / WISD v4 (**writes `S_H = ∞`**); `req_floor_lsn` + UNSTAMPED persistence on the daemon side, **with the `PS_SHM_VERSION` bump for the `PsChannel` change**; PAGE GROW dedup removal and in-memory GROW compaction; `admission_seq_observe_finite` and the sentinel guard (§3.8); the retention owner kind `CHECKPOINT_FENCE` (retention identity bump); identities and fixtures. | ~750 + ~600, plus fixtures |
| **P3b** | Activate branches **together with G3 enforcement, atomically**: write `CAP_ACTIVATION{BRANCH}` and finite `branch_seq`. Branch edges use `branch_seq` in reads, fences, gates and projection in one commit; the registration gate for branch levels; the kept child-first CREATE idempotence. **R2** in `pagestore_prepare_branch_from_control`: the shutdown-checkpoint check via `ps_checkpoint_record_end` info, `pagestore_branch_window_open` + the journaled snapshot, the post-CREATE WAL scan (R2-x), the `r2_cleanup` journal states, the materializer-marker check. `PS_FRONTEND_CAP_BRANCH_SEQ` + the `R2_PROVEN` magic (mixed-version gating); the `ch->result` NEW/FINITE bits; refusal of ∞ results on the safe path; refusal of an unproven retry of a finite branch; readiness written only after a passing post-check and the retry/delete rules. **Direct entry points gated** by `pagestore.allow_unsafe_branch_cut`. Test migrations (§7 table). Ports `run_bugb_suite` and the ancestry suite. | ~900 + ~1050 |
| **P4** | Activate client unstamped. `req_lsn = 0` + `req_floor_lsn`; removes P0's `+1` and `ls_zeroextend`'s stamp; no version bump (it landed in P3a). | ~150 + ~200 |
| **P5** | Activate the other views. **`PS_SHM_VERSION` bump + `PS_FRONTEND_CAP_ATOMIC_PINS` + daemon-side post-activation refusals**; atomic pin registration (§2.3: barrier under `page_prune_lock` with frontier validation, resource-superset hand-off, barrier fence pin, hand-off-only explicit SET, call-site migration); write `CAP_ACTIVATION{PIN, WALIDX_HORIZON, ARTIFACT}`; finite `S_H` from the first commit after activation. Pins positional below R (reads, fences, gate; pins required for exact-R readers); `S_H` caps in the walidx planner and fold; artifact caps and producer `(C, token)`; control-restore client seqs; §5.3 audits; ports the revision suite. | ~850 + ~700 |
| **P6** | Fuzzer (§8.5) and docs (READ_CONSISTENCY_DESIGN §1d, MVP_COMPLETION_PLAN: fork tuple and the controller-only G3 contract; RELEASE_VALIDATION; MVP_STATUS). No G3 code is left here. | ~250 + ~300, plus docs |

Total: about 4.7k lines of code and 4.3k lines of tests, plus fixtures and docs.

**Top risks:**
1. Read/prune divergence, including lost `s_min` facts. Mitigated by one predicate for fold and masks, closure everywhere, and the §8.2 future-arrival property test.
2. Forkmeta masks, closure, derived fences and plan epoch.
3. A missing `admission_seq_observe` for `branch_seq` / `S_H`.
4. The LSN-strict ordered bump and `UINT64_MAX`-as-bare-LSN consumers (grep `fences[`, `PsPruneFence`, `retention_project_lsn`, `admission_seq = projected`).
5. Memory growth from always-recorded GROWs, bounded only by the cutover cadence. A stalled cutover (forkmeta backpressure) must surface through the existing controller.
6. Reader registration (P5): an unpinned exact-R reader now fails closed.
7. G3 R2: its checks (shutdown checkpoint, nextXid, prepared transactions, materializer marker) must fail closed. Retry and delete coordination with the prepare journal must never delete a timeline this call did not create. Test migrations: integration_test switches from an online CHECKPOINT to a fast restart.
8. Client/daemon lockstep (P4).
9. Three format bumps with fixtures.

### 9.1 Order-dependent optimizations removed in rev 3

| Removed | Why | Replacement |
|---|---|---|
| PAGE-class GROW dedup (`fork_event_add` size skip, the `segment_grows`-driven SEG_COMMIT marker for new records), and rev 2's `S_min(tl)` / `max_meta_seq > S_min` rule with its maintenance and recovery-order proof | Correctness depended on which views were registered and on recovery restoring `S_H` before page replay. Three consecutive findings. | Always record; merge only through the planner (§3.2, §3.7(3)). |
| Registration gate allowance "unregistered finite-S read OK if `S ≥ F.seq`" | Correct only if no retention or recording step between the read's S and the read depends on the view. Other planners (forkmeta, in-memory GROW compaction) do not consult `F.seq`. | Every finite-S read must be registered (§3.5). |

**Kept after review, and why they are not order-dependent:**
- `max_meta_seq` / `max_inherited_page_seq` fast-path gates: pure functions of the present event set, recomputed on load.
- Fence-conditional closure: it depends only on the fence set that retention already serializes on (`page_prune_lock` / admission-wr), and later views never use the escape at existing positions.
- ZEROEXTEND persist-skip: META class, view-independent, crash-equivalent.
- The exact-identity GROW collapse: identity, not state.
- Artifact `inflight` caps: correctness, rebuilt deterministically.
- Stable-seq sampling: correctness.

### 9.2 Rollout audit: pre-existing state read with new semantics (rev 6)

| Phase boundary | Pre-existing state | Risk | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| → P3a | Branches, horizons | P3a would write real seqs that later become finite retroactively | P3a writes ∞ (§2.2) |
| → P3a | Forkmeta events written before P3a (no META/UNSTAMPED flags; legacy ZEROEXTEND GROW loads as PAGE) | A post-activation view could fail to hide them | None needed: every such event has a seq below any post-activation S, so it is pre-S and visible to every finite view anyway. Only events admitted after activation can be hidden, and P3a precedes activation, so they carry flags. |
| → P3a | GROWs deduped before P3a | A post-activation view could miss a GROW | None needed: a later view has `S ≥` every earlier event, so the dedup's fold equals its fold (§3.2 argument). |
| → P3b | Legacy branches | Retroactive freeze | ∞ via V3/legacy mapping and `activation_seq[BRANCH]` |
| → P3b | An in-flight controller operation started by an older binary (journal past `fork_captured`) | A retry would return an ∞ branch, or run without R2 proof | The retry gets no `FINITE` bit, so it is refused (§7). It goes to `r2_cleanup` and requires an operator rerun with a new incarnation. It never publishes an uncapped production branch. |
| → P3b | Tests calling the direct entry points | They are refused | GUC migration (§7 table) |
| → P4 | P0 clients (`+1` stamps) mixed with P4 clients (unstamped) | none | The daemon accepts both. A new client with an old daemon is refused by `PS_SHM_VERSION`. |
| → P5 | Pins, readers, WAL-index horizons, artifact fences | Retroactive finite caps over pruned history (4101176495) | Activation epochs (§2.2) |
| → P5 | Artifact attempts in flight across activation (token < activation) | A mixed cap | The token maps to ∞, so the fence stays LSN-only until the next generation. |
| → P5 | The registration gate | Existing unpinned exact-R readers would get -2 (4101247317) | Pre-activation `(R, S)` maps to `(R, ∞, S)` marked `legacy`, which is today's semantics, and is not gated. Readers adopting a *new* generation after activation must pin it first (P5 audit). |
| any, downgrade | A store with `CAP_ACTIVATION` opened by an older binary | Its old retention would prune history finite views need | Fail closed (§2.2) |


### 9.3 P1 scope in detail (start here)

**Goal.** Introduce the §1.2/§1.3 machinery with **every cap set to ∞**, so behaviour is bit-for-bit today's. No persisted format changes, no protocol changes, no retention changes (the planner is P2).

**New types and helpers** (in `pagestore_core.c` unless noted):

| Item | Content |
|---|---|
| `PS_SEQ_UNBOUNDED` | `UINT64_MAX` |
| `typedef struct ViewCap { uint64_t lsn, seq, strict_seq; bool legacy; } ViewCap;` | |
| `viewcap_from_request(read_lsn, read_seq)` | Maps today's request pair `(R, read_seq)` to `(R, ∞, read_seq ? read_seq : ∞, legacy = true)`. This is exactly today's semantics: tuple at R, uncapped below. `read_lsn == UINT64_MAX` (newest) maps to `(∞, ∞, ∞)`. **`read_seq == 0` becomes ∞ here, and 0 is never passed as a cap past this point.** |
| `viewcap_compose(ViewCap c, uint64_t edge_lsn, uint64_t edge_seq)` | §1.2. In P1 every edge seq is ∞. |
| `timeline_branch_seq(tl)` | Returns ∞ in P1; P3b reads the field. |
| `timeline_inherited_below(tl, &has_range)` | `B_k`: `branch_lsn` for a branch. For the root, `has_range = false` (the rule's `−∞`). Do not encode the root as 0, because LSN-0 positions must stay escape-eligible at the root. |
| `page_select(PageEnt *e, const ViewCap *c, uint64_t B)` | §3.1 |
| `page_visible(e, lsn, seq)` | Kept as a wrapper: `page_select(e, &viewcap_from_request(lsn, seq), 0)`. |
| `fork_event_hidden(const ForkEnt *, uint32_t i, const ViewCap *, uint64_t B)` | The single hidden-event predicate (§3.2), shared later by the P2 planner masks. |

**Structures:**
- `ForkEvent.snapshot_dropped` becomes a flags byte: `FEV_F_SNAPSHOT_DROPPED` (bit0, existing meaning), `FEV_F_META`, `FEV_F_META_FIRST`, `FEV_F_UNSTAMPED`. Update every reader and writer of `snapshot_dropped`: `fork_meta_snapshot_build`, `fork_event_compact_dropped_markers`, and the other `snapshot_dropped` sites found by grep. The `_Static_assert(sizeof == 40)` stays.
- `ForkEnt` gains `max_meta_seq`, `max_inherited_page_seq`, `late_meta_idx`, `nlate_meta` and `late_meta_cap`. Free `late_meta_idx` next to `def_idx` (`free_page_fork_indexes`, fork removal paths).
- `TlWalk` gains `ViewCap cap` and `uint64_t inherited_below`. `tl_walk_first(tl, ViewCap)` and `tl_walk_next()` use `viewcap_compose`.

**Functions changed:**

| Area | Functions |
|---|---|
| Classification | `fork_event_add`, `fork_event_add_seg_marker`, `fork_event_insert_pos`: META/META_FIRST/late index/`max_*` maintenance, including the out-of-order insert case. In P1, ZEROEXTEND GROWs get `META` in memory (`fork_grow_with_seq`). UNSTAMPED is set for `req_lsn == 0` ops (`fork_op_lsn` callers in `ps_handle_meta`). Classification has no effect at ∞. |
| Folds | `fork_asof_hop` (fast path = today's code; slow path added), `fork_inheritance_fenced`, `fork_size_asof_hop`, `fork_page_invalidated`, `fork_block_death_through`. These take a `ViewCap*` and `B`. |
| Walks | `read_through_checked`, `read_resolve_version` (including the switch to identity lookups for `ps_memtable_lookup` / `layer_map_lookup`: pass `(pv->lsn, pv->admission_seq)`), `fork_nblocks_through`, `fork_exists_through`, `page_frontier_ancestry_allows`, `fork_asof_query_allowed`. Every `seq_cap = w.lsn == read_lsn ? read_seq : 0` expression is removed. |
| Other callers | `artifact_visible` (signature only), `walidx_plan_bases_build`'s `fork_asof_hop(f, h, 0, …)` calls, `prune_version_needed`'s `fork_page_invalidated` call, and `ps_core_inspection_relation`. |

**Invariants and assertions** (debug builds):
- **I-ALLOC:** a thread-local "shard-wr held for this key's shard" check in the indexed-record allocation paths.
- **U5:** capped reads never resolve a counter-versioned klass.
- The compaction merge preserves `admission_seq` identity.
- No `ViewCap` with `seq == 0` or `strict_seq == 0` is ever constructed.
- `fork_event_check_order()` also verifies the `META_FIRST` / `late_meta_idx` consistency.

**Equivalence argument.**
- With `seq = ∞` and `B = 0` at the reader's level, `fork_event_hidden` is always false, and `page_select` reduces to "the newest at or below L, subject to `seq ≤ X` at L", which is `page_visible` today.
- At ancestor levels P1 composes `(branch_lsn, ∞, ∞)`. Today's `seq_cap = 0` there also means uncapped.
- `B_k` affects only the escape, which is irrelevant when `S = ∞`.
- Hence every result is unchanged.

**Differential test method** (`pagestore_test.c` or a new `pagestore_viewcap_test.c`, test-only):
1. Copy today's implementations verbatim into test-only `ref_page_visible`, `ref_fork_asof_hop`, `ref_fork_inheritance_fenced`, `ref_fork_page_invalidated`, `ref_fork_block_death_through` and `ref_read_through_walk`, via `ps_test_*` hooks. They are frozen references.
2. Randomized histories (seeded, at least 10^5 cases):
   - page versions with random LSNs, including 0, duplicates and equal LSNs with differing seqs, plus legacy seq 0;
   - fork events of every kind, including legacy seq 0 (`nlegacy_seq` > 0 forks exercise the fallback paths), SEG markers and out-of-order inserts;
   - 1–4-level ancestry with random `branch_lsn`;
   - random `(read_lsn, read_seq)`, including 0, `UINT64_MAX` and exact version tuples.
3. Assert that the new functions equal the references on every output: selected `(lsn, seq)`, `nb` plus state, fence result, invalidation, death `(lsn, seq)`, and the ancestry read result.
4. A **literal §1.3 reference**: a brute-force admissibility plus fold written directly from the rule text. Cross-check it against the new functions with **finite** random caps and `B`. This tests the machinery P3b/P5 will activate; it is not wired into production yet.
5. Keep `ps_test_fork_event_index_selftest` and `test_fork_event_index_scaling` green, and add a slow-path step bound.
6. The full existing suite must pass unchanged: meson `--suite pagestore`, `integration_test.sh`, `mvp_golden_test.sh`, `branch_boot_test.sh`, and the op fuzzer with default and 20 seeds. Run `fev_bench` before and after; report it in the PR and target no regression above 5%.

**Out of scope for P1:** formats, retention/planner, gates, R2, and dedup removal (P3a).

**Size:** ~750 lines of code and ~600 lines of tests.

## 10. Open items for implementation review (code-review checklist)

Each item must be confirmed against real code in the named phase PR. Deviations are recorded as amendments in that PR.

| # | Phase | Item to confirm |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | P1 | Every `seq_cap` site was converted. Grep for `read_seq : 0`, `seq_cap`, and `, 0, &nb` in fold calls. No 0-as-cap remains. |
| 2 | P1 | The `snapshot_dropped` → flags conversion did not change the snapshot build/compaction semantics of bit0. |
| 3 | P1 | Memtable/layer identity lookups return the same bytes as before (pgcache keys unchanged). |
| 4 | P2 | Lock order for the WAL-index publish switch: `admission-wr → walidx_publish`, with no shard, prune or map lock taken inside (B). No fsync inside (B). Measure admission stall. |
| 5 | P2 | The forkmeta cutover epoch comparison sits inside its existing admission-wr section and before its switch. Check whether that switch fsyncs under admission-wr; if it does, apply the prepare/switch split. |
| 6 | P2 | `fork_event_admit_seq` is updated under the key's shard lock *before* the admission releases admission-rd. |
| 7 | P2 | The planner masks call the same `fork_event_hidden` / `page_select` as the read path, with no re-implementation. The §8.2 property tests are merge blockers. |
| 8 | P2 | Closure: `prune_version_needed` never drops a closure-required version. `control_chain_keeps` keeps the min-seq note. |
| 9 | P2 | The ordered-path fence bump is LSN-strict for positional fences. Audit every `UINT64_MAX`-as-bare-LSN consumer. |
| 10 | P3a | `PS_SHM_VERSION` is bumped with the `PsChannel.req_floor_lsn` field. Old/new attach is refused both ways. |
| 11 | P3a | Every new format (TLM V3 plus the CAP_ACTIVATION kind, forkmeta V4, FMS v2, WIPG v2, WISD v4, the retention owner kind) has an identity bump and a legacy/current fixture pair (D5). Older binaries fail closed. |
| 12 | P3a | The P3a binary writes ∞ for `branch_seq` and `S_H`. `admission_seq_observe_finite` is used at every new observe site. The restart test with ∞ records passes. |
| 13 | P3a | Recovery loads the timelines log and the retention registry before page replay. This is no longer needed for correctness since dedup was removed; confirm there is no hidden dependency. |
| 14 | P3a | The PAGE GROW dedup removal covers every site (`fork_event_add`, `segment_grows`, `fork_grow_apply`). The below-cutoff admission uses `extends_uncapped`. In-memory GROW compaction runs only after a successful cutover publish. |
| 15 | P3b | CREATE_BRANCH: the `R2_PROVEN` magic in `is_redo`, the NEW/FINITE result bits, and the `PS_FRONTEND_CAP_BRANCH_SEQ` bit. An exact retry of a finite branch without the magic is refused. The safe path refuses ∞ results. |
| 16 | P3b | The R2 entry point ordering: capability → pre-checks (R2-s, window snapshot, R2-m) → CREATE_BRANCH → WAL scan `(L, P]` after `XLogFlush(P)` → readiness plus fsyncs. Cleanup: manifest removal and directory fsync → BEGIN_DELETE. The journal sub-states resume correctly after a crash at every step (fault points). |
| 17 | P3b | `pagestore_branch_window_open` is the first statement after the restricted writer's health check in `execute()`. The controller issues no XID-committing statements after L. |
| 18 | P3b | Reads, fences, projection and the gate flip in one commit. `CAP_ACTIVATION{BRANCH}` is written before serving, under admission-wr. |
| 19 | P3b | Test migrations: `integration_test.sh` switches to a fast restart instead of an online CHECKPOINT, and uses the GUC for the legacy prepare. `branch_boot_test.sh` uses the GUC. The mvp_golden no-XID assertion. |
| 20 | P4 | The client sends `req_lsn = 0` plus `req_floor_lsn` only for WAL-less ops. P0's `+1` and the `ls_zeroextend` insert stamp are removed in the same commit. |
| 21 | P5 | The `PS_SHM_VERSION` bump plus `PS_FRONTEND_CAP_ATOMIC_PINS`. The daemon refuses a post-activation barrier without the magic, a non-hand-off explicit SET, and an artifact BEGIN without `PS_ARTIFACT_BEGIN_CAPPED_READ`. |
| 22 | P5 | The barrier takes `admission-wr → page_prune_lock (wr) → walidx_prune_lock (wr) → map-rd` and validates frontiers exactly like RESERVE (`:20948-20995`). The hand-off requires a resource superset, under `retention_lock` plus the prune locks. |
| 23 | P5 | Every §2.3 call site is migrated (`pagestore.c:~1070-1125`, `:9884`, `:12355`, `pagestore_control.c:241`, `pagestore_branch_prepare.py:1015-1060`, `continuous_redo_demo.sh:360`). The newest-two `CHECKPOINT_FENCE` release marks prune due. |
| 24 | P5 | Activation epochs for PIN / WALIDX_HORIZON / ARTIFACT. Pre-activation reads are `legacy` (tuple at R, not gated). The composed-cap legacy flag is correct through post-activation branch edges. |
| 25 | P5 | The `walidx_commit` `S_H` sampling holds all shards (shard 0 wr, 1..n-1 rd, ascending) before `walidx_publish`. Run TSAN plus the soak. |
| 26 | P5 | Artifact caps (`committed` / `inflight`): the producer reads with `(C, token)`. Caps are rebuilt from completion records only. |
| 27 | all | Every new durable record is covered by fault points (torn/failed append poisons as today). Every refusal path has an explicit status code and a test. |
| 28 | all | Rollout table §9.2 is re-checked against the actual phase contents before each activation phase (P3b, P4, P5). |
