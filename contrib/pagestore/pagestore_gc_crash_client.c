 *
 * pagestore_gc_crash_client.c
 *	Deterministic IPC workload/oracle for the POSIX page-pruning H1 crash
 *	slice.
 *
 * The seed writes three generations of relation history and a newer block 0,
 * arms the named fault marker the harness hands it, then installs a
 * configured page-history owner at 3500.  That cutoff makes
 * maintenance compact the history below it: the replacement layer is
 * published, the retired sources are marked for deletion, and the durable
 * page-prune frontier advances, which are the three named process-abort
 * boundaries this slice crashes at.  The seed then waits to be reaped, so a
 * workload that ends before the fault is reported as unreached.
 *
 * The verify mode checks, after recovery, that the newest block 0 and a block
 * present only in the compacted layer read back, that the retained block 0
 * history at the cutoff is still served, and that the pruned history below
 * the cutoff cannot be resurrected once recovery cleanup has run.
 *
 * The wal_index workload targets the WAL-index compaction boundary instead:
 * a fixed WAL-index reader at 40 under three FPI-led chains on one block and
 * one committed interval, armed before the commit that makes the interval a
 * snapshot candidate.  Its verify mode waits for the retried generation to
 * serve the reader's chain plus the newest chain and requires the dropped
 * point below the durable frontier to stay refused.
 *
 * The wal_reclaim workload ships three sealed 1 MiB segments, publishes a
 * control note at the shipped end, arms the fault, and commits WAL-index
 * progress through the end so the whole prefix is reclaimable.  Its verify
 * mode waits for the prefix reads to be refused and requires the WAL end and
 * retain floor to stay at the shipped end.
 *
 * The timeline_delete workload creates a branch with private shipped WAL, a
 * committed WAL-index interval, an owner layer, and shared-segment pages,
 * arms the fault, and issues BEGIN_DELETE.  Its verify mode waits for
 * DELETED, keeps the parent's page readable, and requires branch reads to be
 * rejected.
 *
 * The manifest_compact workload writes 320 pages while the harness holds
 * maintenance paused, then arms the fault and releases maintenance so layer
 * compaction churn grows the manifest log past its rewrite trigger.  Its
 * verify mode reads every page back.
 *
 * The forkmeta workload layers persisted fork-size events for many relations
 * on the page_prune history, arms the fault, installs the cutoff pin, and
 * keeps trickling fork events so a second generation retires the first.
 * Its verify mode checks current sizes, retained size history above the
 * cutoff, and refused queries below it, on top of the page_prune oracle.
