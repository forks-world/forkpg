 * store directory persists on disk (layers.manifest, forkmeta and its
 * snapshots, image layers, seg_* page segments, the WAL/WAL-index catalogs
 * and their snapshots, retention/timeline/frontier records, the shard-count
 * file).  See fuzz/build.sh for how this is built and fuzz/run_fuzz.sh for
 * how it is run; this header is shared between the libFuzzer entry point
 * (fuzz_target.c) and the non-instrumented replay driver used by the meson
 * corpus-regression test (fuzz_standalone_driver.c).
