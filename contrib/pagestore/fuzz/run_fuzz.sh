#!/usr/bin/env bash
# run_fuzz.sh -- run one or more persisted-format fuzz targets for a fixed
# wall-clock duration, in parallel (one process per target -- the targets
# do enough real filesystem/syscall work per iteration, see fuzz_common.c,
# that -fork=N workers on a single target does not help much; spreading
# across the 21 targets is where the 32 cores earn their keep).
#
# Usage:
#   run_fuzz.sh [-d seconds] [-o out-dir] [target ...]
# With no targets listed, runs every target in fuzz_common.c's table.
# Requires fuzz/build.sh to have been run first.
#
# Each target's working corpus starts as a copy of fuzz/corpus/<target>
# (never mutated in place) and any crash/leak/timeout artifact lands in
# <out-dir>/<target>/crashes/, named by libFuzzer's own content hash.
#
# Round 2 (coordinator review) changes from round 1:
#  - Leak detection is back ON (detect_leaks=1) with
#    lsan_suppressions.txt silencing only the one already-documented,
#    already-triaged leak (known-crashes/manifest/
#    leak_memtable_on_post_alloc_open_failure.txt) so a *new* leak still
#    stops the run and gets caught, instead of every run stopping on run #1.
#  - PS_FUZZ_CRC_FIXUP=1 by default (half of iterations get a structure-
#    aware checksum fixup after mutation -- see fuzz_crc_fixup.c -- the
#    other half stay pure mutation); pass -f 0 to disable for an apples-
#    to-apples round-1-style comparison run.
