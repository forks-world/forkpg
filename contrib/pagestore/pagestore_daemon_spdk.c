/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * pagestore_daemon_spdk.c
 *	  SPDK frontend for the page-store daemon (optional, higher performance).
 *
 * Reuses the shared brain pagestore_core.c verbatim; this file supplies the
 * SPDK-specific bring-up and an *asynchronous, cross-channel* request loop.
 * SPDK is used in library mode (we own the loop).  The loop scans the channels
 * and begins each ready request without blocking: metadata and (buffered) write
 * ops complete synchronously, while read ops submit their page reads to the NVMe
 * queue and the channel's reply is published from the read completions.  So many
 * requests are in flight at once -- effective queue depth is no longer one
 * request's worth.  The portable POSIX daemon is unaffected and remains the
 * default; this binary is built separately (spdk_build.sh) and links SPDK.
 *
 * Argument-compatible with pagestore_daemon so the standalone test harness can
 * drive it: --shm/--store/--page-size/--segment-size; the control disk's PCI
 * address is --pci or $PS_SPDK_PCI.
