/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * backend_localsvc.c
 *	  "localsvc" storage backend: forwards every operation to a separate
 *	  pagestore daemon over a shared-memory mailbox.
 *
 * This is the first backend that takes I/O out of the PostgreSQL process: the
 * backend never opens the data files.  It attaches the daemon's shared-memory
 * segment, claims a private channel, and for each operation posts a request
 * into the channel and busy-waits for the daemon to complete it.  The daemon
 * performs the real storage I/O.
 *
 * Page data crosses the boundary through the channel's data buffer (one copy
 * each way).  For reads on the AIO path, fetch_to_fd() has the daemon place
 * the pages into that buffer and hands the shared-memory fd + offset back to
 * the shim, which issues a normal AIO readv from it -- so PostgreSQL's
 * read-completion machinery runs unmodified.
 *
 * Requires io_method=sync (the AIO read is performed inline by the issuing
 * backend; IO workers would not share this backend's shm fd).
 *
 * src/../contrib/pagestore/backend_localsvc.c

/*
 * WAL-position stamp for a fork-mutating op (create/truncate/unlink).  The
 * daemon keys the fork's size history by it, so as-of NBLOCKS/EXISTS answers
 * resolve against these events like page reads resolve against pd_lsns.
 *
 * Normal operation stamps XactLastRecEnd: the end of the WAL record THIS
 * backend just inserted, which for every caller is the record of the
 * mutation itself -- log_smgrcreate before smgrcreate (core orders WAL
 * before action), SMGR_TRUNCATE just before smgr_truncate, the commit
 * record just before post-commit unlinks.  The global insert pointer would
 * over-stamp: unrelated concurrent inserts push it past the mutation
 * record, and a horizon between the two would miss the mutation.  During
 * replay the honest position is the END of the record being replayed
 * (GetCurrentReplayRecPtr; the last-REPLAYED pointer only advances after
 * rm_redo returns, i.e. it names the PREVIOUS record).
 *
 * XactLastRecEnd == 0 falls back to one of two answers, and the two
 * fallback callers are NOT interchangeable (Codex review finding
 * 4097536209 on PR #294):
 *
 * - CREATE and TRUNCATE reach this fallback when they have no fresh WAL
 *   record of their own for THIS operation yet (e.g. a route_all compute
 *   issuing the op with no preceding log_smgrcreate/SMGR_TRUNCATE record in
 *   this backend since its last commit/abort).  For them, the old
 *   unconditional Max(XactLastCommitEnd, XactLastAbortEnd) fallback could
 *   hand back a stale position -- possibly this session's last, unrelated
 *   commit, or even 0 -- left over from long before some branch was forked
 *   off the same timeline since.  Stamping that stale, too-low position let
 *   the mutation sort at or below the branch's cap and leak into it
 *   (pagestore Bug B: a branch observing parent post-fork metadata
 *   changes).  GetXLogInsertRecPtr() is the honest fix: it can only be >=
 *   anything this backend has produced, so it cannot sort a related
 *   mutation before a record it must follow, and it cannot understate "now"
 *   the way a leftover session value can.  A non-startup backend in
 *   recovery (hot standby) never inserts WAL itself, so it uses the last
 *   replayed position instead -- the same horizon ls_read_lsn() uses for
 *   its own recovery case, just below.
 *
 * - UNLINK's non-redo path runs from smgrDoPendingDeletes() at
 *   end-of-transaction cleanup, AFTER RecordTransactionCommit()/
 *   RecordTransactionAbort() have already reset XactLastRecEnd -- that IS
 *   the documented XactLastCommitEnd/XactLastAbortEnd case above, not a
 *   caller with no WAL record of its own: the commit/abort record it must
 *   sort after already happened, and whichever this backend produced LAST
 *   is the record that decided the cleanup (a commit for a DROP, an abort
 *   for a created-then-rolled-back relation; stamping the older one would
 *   sort the unlink below the relation's own CREATE and resurrect it).
 *   GetXLogInsertRecPtr() is NOT a safe stand-in here: unrelated concurrent
 *   WAL insertion can push the global pointer arbitrarily far past that
 *   commit/abort record, and a branch cut between the real transaction end
 *   and that inflated position would then miss the unlink -- exposing a
 *   dropped relation, or a relation created by an aborted transaction, to
 *   the branch.  UNLINK therefore keeps the original
 *   Max(XactLastCommitEnd, XactLastAbortEnd) fallback.
 *
 * WAL-less mutations (unlogged relations) can leave all of these at older
 * records; their content is not LSN-ordered to begin with.
