/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * pagestore_ipc.h
 *	  Shared-memory IPC protocol between the PostgreSQL backend (localsvc
 *	  backend) and the standalone pagestore daemon.
 *
 * Included by BOTH the PG-side module (with PG headers) and the standalone
 * daemon (without them), so it uses only plain fixed-width C types and defines
 * an identical layout on both sides.  Synchronization uses __atomic builtins on
 * plain uint32 fields.
 *
 * Page-size independence: nothing here hardcodes the engine page size.  The
 * channel data buffer is sized in terms of PS_IO_UNIT -- the transfer/IO unit,
 * deliberately decoupled from the logical page size so that small engine pages
 * (PostgreSQL 8K, InnoDB 16K, ...) never become small network/SPDK transfers.
 * The actual page_size is carried in the shm header and validated at attach.
 *
 * Concurrency: the smgr shim is synchronous (one I/O per backend at a time), so
 * each backend owns one channel with a single request/response mailbox.
 *
