/*
 * Plan retention for one fork's append-ordered event stream.  Events must be
 * nondecreasing in LSN.  Within one LSN, nonzero admission sequences must be
 * nondecreasing even across intervening sequence-zero legacy events; legacy
 * events retain their source order and are visible at every exact sequence
 * fence.
 *
 * The operational cutoff is an exact durable tuple and both its LSN and
 * admission sequence must be nonzero.  Discrete fences may use sequence zero
 * for wildcard same-LSN visibility, but every fence must have a nonzero LSN
 * and lie within the cutoff's visibility domain.  Fences are deliberately
 * accepted in arbitrary order and duplicates are harmless.
 *
 * The planner marks every event not visible at the operational cutoff as the
 * future tail.  For the cutoff and each supplied fence it retains the base
 * the reader resolves there: the latest visible SET/DEAD, the maximum visible
 * GROW strictly after it (or the maximum visible GROW in the whole prefix
 * when no definitive event is visible), and the visible SET/DEAD with the
 * smallest size (latest on a tie), which is the inheritance fence a branch
 * applies to its ancestors.  `required` marks events the caller must keep
 * regardless: a definitive event still needed to invalidate a retained page
 * version that predates it.  The keep mask is the union across all horizons
 * and required events.  keep receives one byte per input event.  The planner
 * uses no storage proportional to the input.  nitems above INT_MAX are
 * rejected because the return type is int.  The planner returns the number
 * kept, or -1 when the input cannot be proven valid and safe.

 * P2 (design doc S3.7, the highest-risk planner): the full-admissibility
 * planner.
 *
 * S3.7 item 1: every mask (the operational cutoff and every fence) uses the
 * exact S1.3/S3.2 admissibility rule -- pagestore_admissible.h's
 * ps_event_hidden(), the same predicate pagestore_core.c's read path uses
 * (P2 requirement 2) -- rather than the plain positional
 * "lsn <= fence.lsn" test.  This lets a finite-seq mask hide a same-position
 * event admitted after a view froze, while a PAGE-class GROW in the
 * inherited range (inherited_below/has_inherited_below, design doc S1.5's
 * B_k) still loses its escape exactly as fork_event_hidden() does.
 *
 * S3.7 item 2: closure.  A retained META event (SET/DEAD, or a
 * ZEROEXTEND-origin GROW) at an escape-eligible position (has_inherited_below
 * is false, or lsn > inherited_below) implies retaining that position's
 * META_FIRST event too -- the fact that it *is* the first arrival must
 * survive even if some mask's fold currently hides it.  A hidden UNSTAMPED
 * event is retained whenever a later event (strictly greater admission_seq,
 * nonzero) at its exact LSN is retained -- S1.6 gives UNSTAMPED no escape of
 * its own, but a later same-LSN event's own retention already pins that
 * position, so keeping the UNSTAMPED event alongside it costs nothing and
 * preserves the position's full history for a cap between the two.
 *
 * S3.7 item 3: GROW retention is unchanged from
 * ps_forkmeta_prune_plan_required() -- retain_horizon() keeps the largest
 * *admissible* PAGE GROW after each mask's latest *admissible* visible
 * definitive event, now computed under the full mask instead of the plain
 * positional test.
 *
 * `required` keeps its ps_forkmeta_prune_plan_required() meaning.  Returns
 * the number kept, or -1 for invalid input (same validation as
 * ps_forkmeta_prune_plan_required(), plus rejecting a fence lsn outside the
 * cutoff's admissibility domain exactly as before).

/*
 * S3.7 item 5: derived fences.  For every live view (l, s, x) with

 * folds everything at or below the cutoff into one snapshot base would
 * silently lose the s1.3 distinction that view's own finite S still needs
 * *at the cutoff position itself* (its own L may be far beyond the cutoff,
 * so its own fence, above, does not reach back to protect the cutoff-time
 * mask).  Emit one extra fence (cutoff.lsn, s, strict = cutoff.admission_seq)
 * per such view, so ps_forkmeta_prune_plan_capped()'s masks at the cutoff
 * still honour it.
 *
 * A view with l == cutoff.lsn sits exactly at the cutoff position, where
 * its own x is an *independent* hard bound (S1.3's "p == l => seq <= x"),
 * binding regardless of s.  Such a view still needs a derived fence
 * whenever x is finite and below cutoff.admission_seq, even if s alone
 * would not trigger one (Codex 4114217415); the derived fence then carries
 * strict_seq = x instead of cutoff.admission_seq, to actually preserve the
 * bound the view depends on.  A view with l > cutoff.lsn never has this
 * exposure: cutoff.lsn is strictly below its own l, so only s applies
 * there.
