 *
 * pagestore_fuzz_test.c
 *	  The pagestore op-sequence fuzzer (layer 1). Stage 1 built the
 *	  framework + relation/WAL/timeline/retention opcodes; stage 2 adds the
 *	  artifact lifecycle opcodes, ADMISSION_BARRIER and the PS_OP_NONE
 *	  refusal probe (all 37 opcodes now covered), a precise (not weak)
 *	  WAL_INDEX_GET membership oracle, a "branch view frozen" oracle for
 *	  Bug B, and a replay-based delta-debugging (ddmin) shrinker.
 *
 * Unlike pagestore_soak_test.c (one long deterministic workload measuring
 * physical footprint over many rounds), this fuzzer's goal is coverage of
 * call x state x interleaving combinations in a short run: it drives a real
 * pagestore_daemon over the shared-memory IPC protocol with a weighted
 * random choice of relation/WAL/timeline/retention/artifact operations,
 * mixing "legal" arguments (consistent with a small in-process model) with
 * "adversarial" ones (bad incarnation, undefined/deleted timelines,
 * malformed lengths, stale retention generations, ...) and checks each
 * response against one of three oracle strictness levels described in the
 * spec this implements (see MVP_STATUS.md and the op-fuzzer design note):
 * MUST (exact match), MUST-REFUSE (status != OK), and MAY-BE-UNAVAILABLE
 * (OK with the exact modeled version, or a refusal -- never wrong content).
 *
 * Opcode coverage (see g_stage1_ops[] below; the name is stage-1-era but
 * the table now lists all 37 -- see FZ_NSTAGE1_OPS): every relation, WAL,
 * WAL-index, timeline, retention and artifact opcode, ADMISSION_BARRIER,
 * and PS_OP_NONE (an unknown-opcode refusal probe), plus clean/crash
 * restarts.  A handful of opcodes remain WEAK ORACLE where an exact
 * prediction needs event-ordering state this stage's model does not keep
 * (see g_weak_oracle_ops[] for the current, precise list of which and why).
 *
 * Model: a small in-process shadow of daemon state -- per timeline
 * (state/incarnation/parent/branch_lsn/wal position, plus a frozen
 * fork-point snapshot for the Bug-B oracle), per relation (existence +
 * "latest" nblocks/tag/lsn per block, like the soak's RelModel), every
 * retention pin this process itself holds, and per-generation artifact
 * lifecycle state.  It is deliberately *not* a full replica of
 * pagestore_core.c's history: where exact prediction would require
 * re-deriving internal event-ordering rules (fork_op_lsn's clamping, page
 * pruning above/below a floor with no local pin, ...), the corresponding
 * check uses the weaker oracle levels the spec allows and this file
 * documents each case inline with "WEAK ORACLE".
 *
 * Environment:
 *   PAGESTORE_FUZZ_SEED     PRNG seed (default: a fixed CI-sized value)
 *   PAGESTORE_FUZZ_OPS      step budget (default: CI-sized, <= ~60s)
 *   PAGESTORE_FUZZ_TRACE    print every op to stderr
 *   PAGESTORE_FUZZ_KEEP     keep the store directory on exit
 *   PAGESTORE_FUZZ_REPLAY=<file>   replay a serialized op-sequence file
 *                           (written by a failure, or by the shrinker below)
 *                           instead of re-driving the generator; set
 *                           PAGESTORE_FUZZ_SEED/_OPS directly (with this
 *                           unset) to re-run the generator the stage-1 way.
 *   PAGESTORE_FUZZ_LOG=<file>      write the human-readable op trace
 *   PAGESTORE_FUZZ_SHRINK           on a failure, ddmin the recorded
 *                           sequence down to a minimal one that still fails
 *                           at the same ck() call site, writing
 *                           <store-dir>.opseq (full) and
 *                           <store-dir>.opseq.min (minimized)
 *   PAGESTORE_FUZZ_SHRINK_BUDGET_S  shrink wall-clock budget (default 300)
 *   PAGESTORE_FUZZ_BUGB_WORKAROUND   ship a throwaway parent WAL record
 *                           right after every CREATE_BRANCH, dodging the
 *                           still-unfixed Bug B race (PR #294) instead of
 *                           exercising it; off by default, forced on by the
 *                           meson test's env until #294 merges -- see
 *                           env_branch_create()/verify_branch_frozen()
 *   PAGESTORE_FUZZ_FORCE_KNOWN    do not skip seeds in g_known_failures[]
 *   PAGESTORE_FUZZ_SHRINK_CHILD    internal: set by the shrinker on its own
 *                           re-exec'd candidate-replay children so they do
 *                           not themselves try to shrink
 *
 * Usage: pagestore_fuzz_test <path-to-pagestore_daemon> [store-base-dir]

 *     token" check -- abandons any still-open older attempt.
 *   - WRITE is just PS_OP_EXTEND/WRITEV(nblocks=1) on the SAME key with
 *     req_lsn/req_seq set to the open attempt's (lsn, token); it does not
 *     touch what ordinary reads see.
 *   - COMMIT(lsn, token, count) with an exact match to the open attempt
 *     (count == the number of *distinct* blocks written) publishes it: from
 *     that instant, EXISTS/NBLOCKS/READV/READ_AT resolve to exactly the
 *     committed generation's blocks (unwritten blocks within nblocks read
 *     as zero, per "missing blocks never inherit an older page") --
 *     regardless of any *later* attempt opened against this key, until
 *     that one also settles (commits or drops).
 *   - DROP(lsn) at a lsn strictly newer than anything this key has ever
 *     used always succeeds and makes the key explicitly nonexistent from
 *     that instant, INCLUDING abandoning any still-open attempt at a lower
 *     lsn the same way a newer BEGIN would (drop's record becomes the
 *     newest COMMIT-block version, so artifact_attempt()'s "last->
 *     admission_seq < token" check on the old attempt's token now fails).
 *   - An exact-lsn retry of the last settled generation is idempotent:
 *     BEGIN again at a COMMITTED generation's own lsn returns its original
 *     token (PS_STATUS_OK, no new attempt); BEGIN or DROP again at a
 *     DROPPED generation's own lsn is refused/succeeds per
 *     PS_ARTIFACT_REFUSE_DROPPED / the drop-of-a-drop short circuit,
 *     respectively (see act_artifact_begin/drop()).
 *   - Any lsn older than the newest BEGIN this key has EVER used (settled
 *     or still open) is PS_ARTIFACT_REFUSE_BEGIN_NEWER; any lsn (other than
 *     an exact retry) older than the last settled generation is

 * by deleting chunks and re-checking.
 *
 * Replay fidelity: run_step() always performs the same rng_below(total)
 * "selection roll" whether or not it ends up using its result (replay mode
 * substitutes the recorded action instead) -- so replaying an *unmodified*
 * sequence file reproduces the exact same rng_state trajectory, and hence
 * the exact same run, as the original.  A *shrunk* sequence necessarily
 * diverges in rng_state from the point of the first removed step onward
 * (fewer actions consume fewer internal rng_below() calls) -- that is
 * expected: shrinking searches for a new, smaller failing input, not a
 * byte-identical replay of the original one.  What must and does hold is
 * that replaying the *same* sequence file twice is deterministic.
