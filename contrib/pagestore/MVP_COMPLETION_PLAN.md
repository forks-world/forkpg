# Pagestore MVP completion plan

This document is the execution plan for closing the remaining pagestore MVP
gates.  [`MVP_STATUS.md`](MVP_STATUS.md) remains the source of truth for current
status and MVP scope; this document records the ordered work packages,
dependencies, acceptance criteria, and decisions that still need agreement.

Update this plan when a decision is made, a pull request lands, or evidence
changes an acceptance criterion.  Do not mark a work package complete merely
because its implementation PR merged: its listed evidence must pass on the
`pagestore` branch.

## Baseline

Baseline as of 2026-08-14:

- PRs #174-#191 have completed their stacked review flow.  The reclamation
  roll-up lands their aggregate on `pagestore`; this includes retention-owner
  lifecycle, page-version pruning, bounded page-history churn, and immutable
  WAL segment/store primitives.
- The local POSIX golden path is green: WAL-only writer -> continuous
  materializer -> durable fork -> independent branch -> process restarts.
- Managed materializer lifecycle and serialized portable branch bootstrap are
  implemented for the default-tablespace local POSIX topology.
- The durable retention registry is consumed by reader and materializer
  controllers.  Image compaction consumes its exact page-history fences and
  publishes a durable reclamation frontier before retiring sources.
- Repeated update/compact cycles bound retained page history.  The live WAL
  path seals validated 1 MiB immutable segments while retaining its flat log
  as the migration/tail authority.  Shipped WAL, WAL-index history, fork
  metadata, and deleted timelines remain unbounded.
- Focused crash tests exist, but the composed fault and persisted-format
  compatibility gates remain open.

Three of the five MVP gates are therefore complete.  The two remaining gates
are:

1. retention-driven, bounded space reclamation;
2. composed crash recovery and persisted-format compatibility.

## Completion definition

The MVP is complete when all of the following are true on `pagestore`:

- the existing composed golden scenario remains green;
- every running fixed/advancing reader and materializer protects the exact
  resources and LSNs it may still consume;
- page history, shipped WAL, and WAL-index history are reclaimed without
  crossing the effective retention floor;
- a deleted timeline is durably and idempotently removed with all of its local
  data, subject to ancestry and owner checks;
- a bounded long-running workload reaches a bounded steady-state disk size;
- process crashes at declared materializer, branch, manifest/layer, and GC
  transitions recover to a valid old or new state, never a torn state;
- persisted-format fixtures prove supported reopen/upgrade paths and fail
  closed on unsupported or corrupt formats;
- the complete pagestore CI suite and the new bounded-space/crash/compatibility
  lanes are green.

S3/Lambda, SPDK layer recovery, multi-writer timelines, user-tablespace portable
bootstrap, and production performance targets remain outside this MVP.

## Dependency order

```text
R0 retention localsvc API
  -> R1 controller owner lifecycle
       -> R2 page-version pruning
       -> R3a segmented-WAL format
       -> R4 WAL-index reclamation/replacement bases

            -> R6 bounded-space acceptance

H0 harness fault/inspection primitives

R2-R5, including R4b, feed GC scenarios in H1.  R6 and H2 close the two MVP
gates.

```

### H1 branch-controller prepared-receipt crash slice

Status: **implemented for the prepared-receipt/service-restore slice**.

`pagestore_branch_prepare` publishes a CRC-protected, configuration-bound
operation journal before changing service state. Recovery only continues a
fully recorded branch boundary and converges the temporary retention pin,
materializer pause, and writer ownership through idempotent/read-only checks.
The four process-abort points cover receipt publication and service-restore
edges. Bootstrap installation, page-store layer recovery, and GC are outside
this slice.

R0 and H0 may proceed independently.  Reclaimers must not be enabled before R1
has made every in-scope runtime owner visible to the retention authority.
R3a may land before R4, but R3b and its bounded-WAL acceptance gate require
R4's replacement bases to have removed the oldest raw-WAL dependencies.

## Retention and reclamation work

### R0. Land the localsvc retention-owner API

Status: **implemented for durable owners and page-history admission; the WAL,
WAL-index, and forkmeta resource frontiers remain coupled to R3/R4/R4b**.

Deliverables:

- `pagestore_localsvc_retention_set()` and owner lookup/enumeration with the
  exact `(LSN, admission_sequence)` fence plus explicit owner generation;
- `pagestore_localsvc_retention_drop()` with explicit owner generation;
- backend declarations and protocol-field documentation;
- tests for successful set/drop, idempotent drop, invalid owner/resource input,
  daemon rejection, and reconnect/restart behavior;
- durable, non-enumerable owner tombstones that retain the maximum accepted
  generation after DROP, including across log compaction and restart.
- persisted per-resource reclamation cutoffs plus exact retained-base
  exceptions.  SET admission and reclaimer
  cutoff selection share one synchronization protocol: a SET below any
  requested `(LSN, admission_sequence)` resource frontier is rejected, while
  an accepted SET is visible before a reclaimer can select a conflicting
  cutoff.  The record/recovery format and lifecycle tests preserve the
  sequence through append, enumeration, compaction, and restart.
- fork metadata shares the page-history reclamation frontier: its compactor
  advances that same full tuple atomically before retiring events, and every
  page-history SET is checked against the maximum of page-image and forkmeta
  progress.  Retention owners declare whether each resource is a point-in-time
  base consumer or a range/replay consumer.  A point-in-time owner may retain
  a sparse fixed-reader base `F` while its
  operational cutoff advances to `C > F`: admission accepts `F` and tuples at
  or above `C`, but rejects reclaimed tuples in `(F, C)`.  The durable cutoff
  and exact exception set are updated crash-atomically and consulted by page,
  WAL, WAL-index, and forkmeta admission; tests cover restart and exception
  removal after the owning reader drains.  Materializers and other range
  consumers must instead declare their full required interval; admission
  rejects them unless that interval is continuously retained and never treats
  equality with a discrete reader base as sufficient proof.
- the R0 wire/API and durable owner record carry a controller allocation-domain
  token distinct from the per-owner generation, plus durable live-token
  reservation.  R1 clients must reserve and transmit it from their first
  deployment; older records are upgraded to explicit live exceptions before
  any R5 allocation-domain frontier may advance.
- recovery resumes the global admission-sequence allocator strictly above the
  maximum sequence in every durable pin, reclamation frontier, branch fence,
  page/forkmeta record, and other sequence-bearing state before admitting a
  mutation; alternatively, allocation advances a durable high-water mark
  before returning a sequence.

Acceptance:

- the backend carries the controller-assigned generation and exact admission
  sequence on every durable SET, returns both through lookup, and reports a
  stale-generation rejection distinctly;
- failures are reported without pretending the pin was installed or removed;
- a delayed SET or DROP below the tombstone generation is rejected, and a
  same-generation SET cannot resurrect a dropped owner; tests cover both
  orderings before and after restart/compaction;
- callers can distinguish `PS_STATUS_STALE` from a general daemon error;
- standalone, PostgreSQL integration, and retention recovery tests pass.

Expected scope: one PR.

### R1. Register reader and materializer owner generations

Status: **implemented for managed materializers and fixed/advancing readers;
decision D2 is accepted below**.

Deliverables:

- stable owner identity and monotonically replaceable generation for each
  managed materializer and fixed/advancing reader;
- registration before a process can consume retained history;
- atomic advancing-reader handoff: prepare and validate the newer view while
  the old pin remains active, then prevent every old-view request while the
  durable pin advances and the runtime switches views (or use an equivalent
  protocol with the same no-gap property);
- pins survive ordinary process shutdown and restart.  Release happens only
  during authoritative deprovisioning or after a durable handoff to another
  owner that protects an equal-or-older safe horizon;
- authoritative deprovisioning first fences new operations for that owner and
  drains every already-admitted page, WAL, and index operation (or retains an
  equivalent per-operation pin) before durably dropping the owner pin;
- supervisor handoff/restart behavior that never creates an unprotected window;
- status/inspection output that identifies active and stale owners.

Safety rule: uncertainty keeps data.  An ambiguous SET/DROP must either leave
the old pin/view pair usable or fail closed until a later authoritative
reconciliation proves which durable owner state won.

Acceptance:

- process start, handoff, advancement, clean stop, crash, daemon restart, and
  duplicate-owner tests cover each lifecycle transition;
- no runtime can serve or redo at LSN `R` unless its required resource masks are
  protected at or below `R`;
- a registration racing page/WAL/index reclamation either installs before
  cutoff selection or is rejected below the already durable frontier; it can
  never report protection for reclaimed history;
- a stale owner can be identified and explicitly reconciled without wall-clock
  expiry changing correctness.

Expected scope: two PRs, materializer then reader.

### R2. Prune page versions during image compaction

Status: **implemented in the reclamation roll-up**.

Image compaction consumes exact page-history fences, retains discrete reader
and descendant bases, publishes the durable frontier before source retirement,
and fails closed below reclaimed history.

An effective floor of zero means that no retention owner constrains page
history; it is not a literal LSN cutoff.  In that case the GC cutoff is the
latest horizon proven durable and materialized for the timeline.  Compaction
must fail closed if no such horizon has been established.  All page-history
pins and reclamation frontiers are ordered `(LSN, admission_sequence)` fences,
not bare LSNs: for every retained fence compaction preserves the newest version
not later than that exact fence.  This keeps the version visible before a
same-LSN hint rewrite as well as the version visible after it.

Branch points are discrete structural base requirements, not moving retention
floors.  A child at fork fence `F` requires the parent base visible at `F`, but
does not pin every later parent version.  The parent's operational GC cutoff
and fixed-reader pins follow the same discrete-base rule: each fixed fence
retains the state visible at that fence while the operational frontier may
advance past it.  The bounded-space soak keeps a fixed reader alive while its
timeline receives continuing updates and verifies bounded page, forkmeta,
WAL-index, and raw-WAL storage.
The operational frontier may continue to advance while compaction retains
those discrete bases for all live descendants.  Durable timeline metadata
stores only `branch_lsn` (`TimelineMeta`, pagestore_core.c) -- there is no
persisted `branch_admission_sequence`.  Ancestor reads cap each level purely
by LSN (`tl_walk_next()`): a branch's frozen `read_lsn` equals `branch_lsn`
at its own fork point, so a same-LSN post-fork mutation is kept out of the
child not by a stored tuple but by never being *admitted* at or below that
LSN in the first place.  Every admission path enforces this: relation pages
and control images below their own timeline's floor are remapped to that
floor (the `SEG_CLAMPED_ADMISSION_MAGIC` "ordered" record shape); and,
symmetrically, an admission on an *ancestor* of a live branch is promoted
strictly above the branch's cap when landing at or below it is ambiguous
enough to be a leak rather than genuine WAL-ordered history.  Only one shape
is ambiguous enough to promote: reusing an lsn this same key already has a
record at -- a same-key/same-position rewrite (skip-WAL hint bits keep the
old pd_lsn for a relation page or control image, `page_has_version_at()`;
the fork-metadata analogue is `fork_event_exists_at()`) -- because
`page_visible()`'s admission-sequence tie-break would let a fresh rewrite at
that lsn silently supersede the version a branch or pin had frozen, and that
rewrite is necessarily later than the original admission it collides with.
An unstamped fork-meta mutation (`req_lsn == 0`) is the other promoted
shape, the same "no real WAL-based claim" treatment a WAL-less relation page
(lsn 0) already gets.  Landing *exactly* at a branch's cap is deliberately
**not** by itself a promotion trigger any more: a real first admission whose
own lsn genuinely IS the fork LSN belongs to that fork's inclusive as-of-L
snapshot, not a leak, and an earlier revision of this fix wrongly hid it by
treating every exact-boundary lsn as post-fork (Codex review finding
4097536244).  A distinct, strictly-lower lsn that collides with nothing
already recorded is left unpromoted regardless of its relation to any cap:
it is ordinary WAL-ordered history that must remain visible to the branch
however late it is physically admitted (a COW branch's whole point).
Because only a collision (or an unstamped event) can trigger promotion, the
promotion path checks that cheap condition first and only pays for the exact
fence computation when it fires -- there is no separate fast-path cache of
descendant caps to maintain (an earlier revision's `timeline_desc_cap[]`
lock-free cache was deleted for exactly this reason: once promotion no
longer fires on cap equality alone, a cheap collision pre-check makes the
cache unnecessary, and the cache could itself go stale between a sibling
branch's deletion and the next admission, reversing admission order --
Codex review finding 4097536226).  The promoted target is the maximum of
every relevant fence at or above the colliding lsn, plus one, AND the key's
current newest visible lsn/version (so shrinking the live-descendant set,
e.g. deleting a sibling branch, cannot make a later promoted event sort
*before* one promoted earlier while that sibling was still live -- a fresh
admission sequence always sorts after an older one at an equal lsn).  This
walks every live descendant, including grandchildren, via the same fence set
the ordered-record path already used for the floor case: relation pages and
fork-metadata events reuse `page_prune_fences()` (branch caps and active
PAGE_HISTORY pins -- see `page_has_version_at()`, `fork_event_exists_at()`,
and `fence_promote_lsn()`/`fork_meta_lsn_promote()` in pagestore_core.c for
the CREATE/UNLINK/TRUNCATE/ZEROEXTEND fork-metadata events), while control
images use the broader `control_prune_fences()` set -- WAL-only retention
pins and retained artifact cutoffs also protect a control image, not just
PAGE_HISTORY pins and branch caps (Codex review finding 4097536254).  This
promotion is what closed Bug B (a branch seeing writes its parent admitted
after the fork): before it, only the floor-remap direction was enforced, so
a post-fork parent write reusing an already-recorded lsn (e.g. a hint-bit
rewrite, or a stale/derived op-LSN -- see `ls_op_lsn()`,
backend_localsvc.c) was admitted unchanged and read straight through into
the child.  `ls_op_lsn()`'s stale-op-LSN fallback is itself split by opcode:
`smgrDoPendingDeletes()`'s end-of-transaction UNLINK cleanup runs after
`XactLastRecEnd` has already been reset by commit/abort, so it keeps the
original `Max(XactLastCommitEnd, XactLastAbortEnd)` fallback (the commit/
abort record it must sort after already happened; `GetXLogInsertRecPtr()`
is not a safe stand-in, since concurrent WAL insertion can push the global
pointer arbitrarily far past that record), while CREATE and TRUNCATE, which
have no transaction-end record of their own, fall back to
`GetXLogInsertRecPtr()` (or `GetXLogReplayRecPtr()` under
`RecoveryInProgress()`) (Codex review finding 4097536209).

Branch creation participates in the same cutoff-selection fence as owner SET.
It validates the requested `(LSN, admission_sequence)` against the durable
page, WAL, WAL-index, and forkmeta frontiers before publishing the child; a
frontier already beyond any required base rejects the branch.  Control-object
versions are protected independently by the WAL floor: compaction retains the
newest usable control image and redo-floor note at or below every retained WAL
boundary even when the page-history floor is newer.
If SLRU capture yields a replay base `C` earlier than branch fence `L`, branch
preparation validates and temporarily pins both WAL and page history at `C`
before seeding: WAL protects the replay stream, while page history protects the
exact SLRU image that seeding must resolve at `C`.  Both protections remain
until the branch artifact and its structural retention are durable.
Temporary pins belong to a durable branch-preparation operation ID with
`preparing -> committed|aborting -> complete` transitions.  Success converts
them atomically to structural retention; abort first fences the operation and
drains admitted seeding, then authoritatively drops both pins.  Restart resumes
either transition idempotently, so an abandoned preparation cannot leave an
unbounded orphan.  Fault tests stop before and after every state publication,
pin SET/DROP, seeding drain, and structural handoff.

Deliverables:

- a precise keep/drop rule that retains the newest required base version at or
  below the floor and every version required above it;
- descendant pins projected through each fork cap;
- structural branch ancestry preserved independently of explicit owners;
- install-new-before-delete-old manifest transition;
- durable publication of the full `(LSN, admission_sequence)` page reclamation
  frontier before any pruned source image layer is marked deleting or removed;
  recovery must therefore reject a below-frontier SET or branch even after a
  crash at every replacement/frontier/source-retirement boundary;
- publication of the replacement to every durability tier represented by its
  sources before deletion begins there (or retention of the old remote copies
  until that publication is durable);
- idempotent local and remote deletion retries;
- crash-safe page-log reclamation after the pruned replacement and frontier are
  durable: recovery ignores dropped references, mixed segments are rewritten
  or retained until every live record is covered, and only then are source
  segments removed;
- pruning statistics and inspection output.

Acceptance:

- reads at every retained horizon agree before and after compaction;
- reads below the declared floor may be rejected, but never return a wrong
  version;
- branch divergence, relation truncate/drop/recreate, restart, and injected GC
  failures preserve the rule;
- repeated update/compact cycles stop growing retained page history.

Expected scope: one implementation PR and, if needed, one fault-test PR.

### R3. Reclaim shipped WAL

Status: **R3a immutable segment/store primitives and live-path integration are
implemented.  R3b-1 supplies the durable retained-base foundation and R3b-2
supplies a standalone physical immutable-prefix reclamation primitive; the R3
cutoff policy, core maintenance integration, and complete shipped-WAL gate
remain open**.

The transition path accepts the existing arbitrary-size archive IPC chunks in
the flat staging log, seals every complete contiguous segment-aligned 1 MiB
logical range into an immutable segment, and prefers validated segments for
reads.  Startup reopens the segment catalog, removes only strictly recognized
staging orphans,
validates headers and bounded payload chunks, compares the sealed prefix with
the still-authoritative flat history, and seals any complete tail missed by a
pre-publication crash.  R3b may make retained-base metadata authoritative and
reclaim flat prefixes only after R4 removes their remaining raw-WAL
dependencies.

Each flat `wal_<timeline>` record is self-describing.  The POSIX backend copies
the retained suffix from a complete record boundary, fsyncs it, and atomically
replaces the old log while serializing physical append/truncate publication.
The core holds a WAL catalog cutover lock, translates every surviving physical
offset, and trims only records fully covered by validated immutable segments.
Restart discovers the immutable store's start from its own headers instead of
depending on the removed flat prefix; retries are compared against immutable
bytes, so reclaim cannot reopen a divergent-history window.  Concurrent reads
either finish on the old inode/offset catalog or begin on the new pair.

This bounds the duplicate flat staging tail.  R3b-1 adds a checksummed v2
identity carrying the physical directory start, retained base, and append end,
validates that tuple against the complete contiguous directory on reopen,
migrates the old v1 identity only after validation, and exposes a monotonic
logical retained-base advance.  That low-level advance deliberately never
authorizes deletion.  R3b-2 adds
`ps_wal_store_reclaim_prefix(target_lsn)`: under the WAL mutex it first
atomically publishes matching retained-base and physical-start frontiers, then
unlinks only segments strictly below the aligned target.  The mutex drains an
already-started read and bars new reads below the published frontier.  Partial
unlink updates the in-memory catalog only after each successful unlink;
directory-fsync ambiguity fences the instance, and reopen uses the published
frontier to validate and idempotently retry any residual authorized prefix.
The primitive rejects rollback, unaligned or beyond-end targets and never
selects a retention cutoff.  It does not integrate core maintenance, owner
admission, flat-WAL reclamation, or WAL-index replacement-base policy.  The
compacted WAL index still names FPI records in raw WAL; until those FPIs are
published as independent replacement page bases, their immutable WAL segments
remain reconstruction dependencies.

Deliverables:

- segmented WAL storage or another agreed crash-safe prefix-reclaim format;
- persisted base/end metadata with checksum and reopen validation;
- WAL append and base/end replacement share a cutover lock (or frozen sequence
  plus durable tail handoff), so an append acknowledged during reclamation is
  represented exactly once in the replacement metadata or its tail.  Crash
  tests overlap appends with every metadata publication boundary;
- append/read across physical segment boundaries and branch ancestry;
- reclamation driven by an independently advancing operational WAL cutoff;
  fixed-reader and branch fences retain only their discrete replacement bases
  and do not pin every later WAL record;
- the authoritative per-timeline WAL retained-base frontier is durably
  published before any segment below it is unlinked.  SET and branch admission
  consult that same metadata; crash tests stop between frontier publication and
  each unlink and prove recovery rejects requests below the retained base;
- a read-lifetime pin/reference for every selected physical WAL segment, with
  unlink deferred until existing readers drain (or an equivalent epoch/barrier),
  including a concurrent read-versus-reclaim fault test;
- explicit protection for restorable control images, in-progress WAL-index
  scanning, and the durable WAL-index resume position even while no scan is
  running.  Reclamation cannot cross the undecoded interval after that resume
  point unless durable replacement page coverage proves the entire interval is
  unnecessary;
- migration or fail-closed handling for the existing flat format.

R3b-2 delivers the standalone frontier-before-unlink, mutex reader barrier,
partial/idempotent prefix unlink, and ambiguous directory-fsync fence portions
of these requirements.  Its residual-prefix path fully enumerates and validates
canonical names, sorts candidates, requires a contiguous suffix immediately
below the target, and only then unlinks in ascending order.  The main catalog
path also revalidates each complete segment header, length, and payload CRC
immediately before unlink, so corruption stops at the current segment and
cannot cross it.  The focused tests also use real child `_exit` stops before
unlink, after a partial unlink, and before directory fsync, plus a deterministic
reader/reclaimer mutex ordering.  Scan errors and corrupt candidates cause zero
further deletion or an immediate stop, while a corrupt low residual prefix makes
reopen fail closed until repaired.
Operational cutoff selection, core maintenance wiring, retention-owner
admission, WAL-index dependency removal, and continuous bounded-space
acceptance are now supplied conservatively by R3b-3 on the POSIX path.

R3b-3 is the conservative POSIX/core policy integration for that reclaimer.
It admits at most one LIVE timeline per maintenance tick, drains ordinary
admission before taking the WAL-index prune/publish gates, and takes one
timeline WAL write lock.  All shard locks are released after the in-memory
WAL-index dependency snapshot and before control-image reads, layer I/O,
metadata publication, or unlink.  The candidate is the segment-aligned-down
minimum of the effective WAL retention floor, durable WAL-index progress, and
the oldest surviving raw WAL dependency.  Missing durable proof, pending or
malformed snapshot state, non-POSIX providers, and any publication/unlink
failure do not authorize deletion and retry after one second.  Durable
retained-base metadata, including a naturally nonzero base after restart, is
the sole admission frontier; physical directory start is not a runtime field
or fence.

This R3b-3 slice intentionally does not implement sparse/discrete retained
base crossing or a bounded fixed-reader soak; those remain explicit follow-up
acceptance work.

With no owner floor, the WAL cutoff is the newest restart/recovery boundary
whose control image and required WAL are durably published.  It is independent
of discrete ancestor WAL bases required by live branches.  Reclamation fails
closed until that boundary is proven, and persists its resulting per-timeline
frontier so later pins and branches below it are rejected.

The WAL cutoff also includes the oldest raw WAL record referenced by every
surviving WAL-index reconstruction chain.  R3 cannot cross an indexed FPI/base
until R4 has durably published an equivalent replacement page base and removed
that WAL dependency; index progress by itself never authorizes WAL deletion.

Acceptance:

- WAL read/restore results are identical before and after reclaim at every
  retained LSN;
- reclaim never crosses a control, branch, reader, materializer, or indexing
  requirement;
- crash at create, fsync, publish, and unlink boundaries reopens safely;
- a continuous WAL-only workload reaches bounded WAL disk usage.

Expected scope: two or three PRs (format, reclaimer, crash/migration coverage),
coordinated or stacked with R4 where the acceptance criteria overlap.

### R4. Compact and reclaim the WAL index

Status: **implemented for the MVP POSIX path**.  New records durably carry
known/FPI metadata and decoded record-end LSNs; legacy records remain unknown
and conservatively unprunable.  Timeline compaction proves every page across
all configured shards, retains the union of the operational FPI-led chain,
discrete owner/branch chains, and the future tail, and falls back to a complete
snapshot if any shard cannot prove a base.  A checksummed durable timeline
frontier rejects unrepresented reads, pins, and branches after restart.

Snapshot publication now also exposes an explicit staged boundary: prepare
writes, checksum-validates, and fsyncs every immutable shard without changing
the selected manifest; commit revalidates those files and atomically selects
the generation.  R4 frontier integration can therefore publish its durable
reclamation fence between prepare and commit, matching the page-compaction
write-replacement-before-frontier-before-retirement ordering.  Live cutover
uses exactly that order, then removes discarded entries from memory only after
the compacted manifest is selected.  If a crash leaves the durable frontier
ahead of the selected snapshot, recovery serves the conservative old snapshot
but backpressures WAL-index append/progress, WAL-index pin mutation, and branch
creation until it retries the already-prepared generation; its immutable
replacement inputs therefore cannot diverge during the recovery window.

R4a publishes every per-shard snapshot as an immutable checksummed file before
atomically replacing one checksummed timeline manifest.  Recovery validates
the complete selected generation and never discovers an unpublished partial
generation by directory scan.  Identical publication retries are idempotent,
divergent retries and generation rollback fail closed, and old generations
remain reachable for reader-drain and later reclamation.  Live maintenance now
freezes append/progress and drains admitted index readers under the existing
publish lock, publishes all shard images, and records each source-log offset.
Recovery restores the selected generation and replays only the tail after those
absolute offsets.  Once a newer manifest is durable, maintenance validates it
and idempotently removes older immutable snapshot shard generations; newer
unpublished retry files are preserved.  New payloads also name one prepared,
durable log epoch per shard.  The manifest atomically selects those empty log
epochs with the snapshot, later appends land only in the selected epochs, and
maintenance removes legacy/older log epochs.  Snapshot entries are now pruned;
raw WAL reclamation remains R3b.

Deliverables:

- compacted per-(timeline, shard) durable index representation;
- removal below an independently advancing operational WAL-index cutoff while
  retaining the necessary reconstruction base at every fixed owner/branch
  fence;
- atomic publication and old-log deletion;
- bounded startup replay and compaction scheduling off serve threads.

With no owner floor, the WAL-index cutoff is the latest completely indexed and
durably published WAL horizon for which every retained page also has a durable
reconstruction base.  Index progress alone is not a reclamation proof: for each
page, compaction retains its required FPI/base entry and every redo entry from
that base through each retained horizon.  Discrete branch-point lookup bases
are retained separately.  Compaction fails closed without that proof and
persists the per-(timeline, shard) reclaimed frontier before removing entries,
so a later registration below it cannot be admitted.  Timeline-level SET and
branch admission atomically aggregate these frontiers and reject below the
maximum reclaimed tuple across every relevant shard; a lagging shard cannot
mask missing history on a more advanced shard while frontiers move.

Index append and compaction publication share a cutover protocol.  The
compactor freezes an append sequence under the shard append lock, publishes a
replacement through that sequence, then hands off and durably appends any tail
before replacing the old log.  All replacement shards and the shard-0 durable
progress record are named by one durable publication generation.  The complete
old generation remains reachable until every replacement shard and its exact
required-byte offsets are durable, after which one atomic generation manifest
makes the new set visible; recovery selects only a complete generation and
never combines old shards with new progress.  Acknowledged concurrent appends
can never be omitted by publication.
Publication also runs on the owning shard's run-to-completion path and drains
all admitted `walidx_get()` readers before retiring the old arrays/log.  An
equivalent epoch/reference scheme is acceptable only if old representations
remain reachable until their final reader exits; tests overlap reads with
cutover and retirement.

Acceptance:

- retained `redo_page_asof` results match before and after compaction;
- incomplete final records, complete corruption, interrupted publication, and
  daemon restart are covered, including concurrent appends at every publication
  crash boundary;
- repeated WAL indexing and compaction reaches bounded index size.

Expected scope: one or two PRs.

### R4b. Compact and reclaim fork metadata

Status: **runtime implementation, the POSIX crash matrix, and the composed
H1 publication scenarios are implemented, and the acceptance matrix's
concurrency clause is closed on POSIX**.  Per-horizon existence/size
equivalence across compaction is exercised by the R6 soak's reader and
branch verifications, every publication boundary by the composed daemon
scenarios, and crash recovery by the matrix; and acknowledged concurrent
mutations are verified exactly once at every publication boundary, two
ways.  The matrix's deterministic concurrent appender -- which holds
admission-rd until the maintenance pass has entered its blocking
admission-wr behind it, then completes its append and records the ack --
now runs at prepare, manifest-commit and snapshot-GC as well as
source-rewrite (every boundary sits under that admission-wr, so at each
the acknowledged mutations are the last before the frozen sequence).  It
creates a relation of its own and grows it, under one admission-rd hold,
with both acks entered in its ledger before the hold is released, so the
crash cannot land between a mutation and its ack; recovery must show the
relation at exactly the acknowledged size and -- since a SET or GROW is
idempotent, and neither existence nor size can tell one application from
two -- carry each acknowledged event's record exactly once across what
recovery composes (the selected snapshot's checkpoint and tail parts and
the source records after its base marker, or the whole source when
nothing is selected).  The composed `forkmeta` workload's post-cutoff
trickle is tracked by its oracle: the seed enters every trickle create
and growth in a ledger (`--ack-file`) twice, as pending before the
request is sent and as acknowledged once the daemon has answered, each
entry fsynced before the next step; the first eight relations are
acknowledged while maintenance is still paused, so the ledger is never
empty at the crash; the verify after recovery, and again after the
additional restart, requires every acknowledged create to exist and every
acknowledged growth to show exactly two blocks, allows a pending,
unacknowledged step either outcome (the daemon may have answered without
the client recording it), holds a growth never sent to zero, and nothing
else; and the harness counts each acknowledged event's record across the
selected generation's parts and the source behind its marker, requiring
exactly one.  SPDK remains outside the claim.

The pure forkmeta keep-planner and exhaustive unit/property coverage now define
the event visibility, exact-fence base retention, legacy sequence handling, and
fail-closed input contract.  Meson and standalone CI run this planner directly.
A durable POSIX checkpoint/captured-tail format foundation now also exists: a
single selected generation is discovered through a checksummed manifest, with
immutable checkpoint and tail files, staged prepare/commit, exact tuple fences,
bounded reads, recovery, and conservative GC.  This runtime slice now wires
that format into daemon/tiering builds and core maintenance: the controller
holds the admission, all-shard, page-prune, WAL-index, and map fences, derives
the cutoff from the lexicographic minimum durable page frontier, commits the
manifest, atomically rewrites the forkmeta epoch with a matching snapshot-base
marker, and leaves the live in-memory arrays conservative for SPDK readers;
restart rebuilds compacted arrays from the selected snapshot.  The versioned
snapshot payload records the exact cutoff and frozen admission highwater.
Startup treats the selected snapshot as authoritative over an old epoch, while
preserving a matching marker's complete post-cutover suffix.  Ambiguous
manifest publication or source rewrite poisons the runtime until restart.  The
first crash-matrix slice now covers real child-process aborts at durable
prepare, manifest-commit, source-rewrite, and completed snapshot-generation GC
boundaries. It reopens each store in a fresh parent, checks the exact named
fault report and exit 88, and covers deterministic concurrent append overlap
plus four configured POSIX shards. This work does not claim coverage of every
internal unlink/fsync instruction, SPDK hardware, or the remaining composed H1
crash scenarios at the time it landed; the composed `forkmeta` daemon
scenarios now cover those boundaries, with the acknowledged-append ledger
as their concurrent-mutation oracle, and SPDK stays outside the claim.

The shared append-only `forkmeta` stream reconstructs historical relation
existence and size, so it is retained with page history rather than treated as
current-state-only metadata.

Deliverables:

- compaction against an independently advancing operational forkmeta cutoff;
  each owner/branch fence below it retains only the exact visible base tuple.
  With no proven operational cutoff compaction fails closed and does not use a
  fixed owner's minimum as the moving cutoff;
- discrete descendant fork fences retained as required historical bases rather
  than projected as a moving floor that pins all later parent metadata;
- for each relation incarnation and each retained owner/branch fence, the
  definitive create/size/existence base visible at that `(LSN,
  admission_sequence)` fence, plus every event required above the operational
  cutoff;
- preservation of same-LSN admission ordering needed by retained reader
  fences;
- restartpoint/materialization publication captures and durably stores a full
  `(LSN, admission_sequence)` barrier; an LSN-only marker never authorizes a
  page or forkmeta cutoff when same-LSN mutations can exist;
- bounded replay from an atomically published checkpoint plus tail, with the
  old log removed only after the replacement and directory entry are durable.
- an append cutover barrier or sequence handoff: publication freezes a precise
  input sequence, and every concurrent create/extend/truncate/drop/recreate is
  either included in the replacement tail or redirected to the new log before
  publication becomes visible; no append may fall between snapshots.

Acceptance:

- relation existence and size at every retained horizon match before and after
  compaction;
- crashes before replacement publication, after publication, and during old
  log removal reopen to the complete old state only before the replacement is
  durably published and to the complete new state after publication; no fault
  during source-log removal may roll acknowledged metadata back;
- concurrent metadata mutations at every publication/crash boundary reopen
  with every acknowledged event exactly once;
- H1 exercises each publication boundary before R6 begins its soak
  (composed daemon scenarios now cover prepare, manifest commit, source
  rewrite, and snapshot GC).

Expected scope: one implementation PR and one crash-test PR.

### R5. Delete timelines durably

Status: **foundation, POSIX runtime quiescence, layer/private-WAL cleanup, and forkmeta filtering implemented**.  The first
slice adds legacy-only migration and V2 create/event mixed records,
LIVE/DELETING state plus a reserved DELETED format value with incarnation,
BEGIN_DELETE/STATE IPC, and descendant/retention-owner admission vetoes.  The
POSIX path now holds an independent lifecycle read gate across every complete
ordinary request and maintenance task, including handed-off async workers;
BEGIN_DELETE takes lifecycle
write, then admission write, then map write.  A fair turnstile closes new
readers once a delete writer queues, independent of the platform's default
pthread rwlock reader/writer preference.  SPDK BEGIN_DELETE remains
fail-closed: async request drain is still follow-up work.  DELETING timelines
now durably mark and asynchronously reclaim manifest-owned local and remote
layers, resume after restart, retry provider failures with backoff, and
reconcile deterministic remote objects from completed-but-unpublished uploads.
DELETING owners are also removed from the shared forkmeta checkpoint, tail,
and source epoch through the existing crash-safe R4b publication protocol;
surviving owners are retained losslessly in the deletion-forced generation.
The POSIX deletion worker now also removes the target's flat and immutable WAL,
WAL-index epochs/watermarks, and WAL-index snapshot directory after validating
the complete owner-scoped set.  Partial removal reopens without parsing the
deleting owner's artifacts and resumes idempotently; live sibling artifacts are
untouched.  POSIX maintenance now also parses and atomically filters every
shared page segment containing the deleting owner, preserving survivor record
bytes and rebasing the covered-prefix watermark before same-id replacement.
Restart scans the filtered stream and never rebuilds DELETING owners; SPDK
leaves this callback NULL.  POSIX maintenance now revalidates every durable
consumer, appends and fsyncs a same-incarnation DELETED state event, and only
then publishes DELETED in memory.  DELETED timelines remain defined and reject
  normal operations.  POSIX CREATE_BRANCH reuses an ID only from durable DELETED
  with exactly the next nonzero incarnation, after purging incarnation-local
  runtime state; STATE returns the current token and requests for incarnations
  greater than one must carry it.  SPDK async drain remains fail-closed: its
  daemon rejects reuse CREATE_BRANCH before shared-core entry.  WAL and control
  restore clients receive the immutable token from their startup
  configuration/manifest and propagate it; control restore never queries
  mutable STATE.

Deliverables:

- an atomic durable transition from live to deleting that first fences all new
  owner registrations and page/WAL/timeline operations, then drains every
  already-admitted operation and timeline-scoped maintenance task before
  physical cleanup.  The drain includes compaction, tier upload/eviction,
  remote GC, and cache/background publication, so none can recreate an
  artifact after cleanup;
- deletion admission checks for descendants, every non-dropped durable owner
  (whether its process is active or offline), and structural retention
  requirements performed as part of that fenced transition; only an
  authoritative DROP or completed safe handoff removes an owner's veto;
- durable timeline tombstone/state transition carrying a monotonically
  increasing timeline incarnation generation;
- idempotent removal of manifests, layers, page segments, WAL, WAL index,
  control/SLRU metadata, fork metadata, and object-tier copies;
- remote uploads use a durable operation identity or upload-intent record
  published before object creation.  Startup and deletion reconcile every
  completed-but-unpublished upload, so a crash between `upload_layer()` and
  manifest publication cannot leave an undiscoverable object or collide with
  a reused layer identity;
- shard page segments shared with live timelines are reclaimed only by a
  crash-safe filtered rewrite plus durable coverage transition; deletion never
  unlinks a mixed source segment and never permits ID reuse while an
  old-incarnation record remains recoverable from it;
- the shared `forkmeta` log is reclaimed by an R4b-style crash-safe filtered
  checkpoint/tail rewrite that removes only the deleted incarnation; deletion
  never unlinks the shared stream or permits ID reuse until the filtered
  replacement and its coverage transition are durable;
- restart resumes deletion and never resurrects a deleted timeline;
- timeline-ID reuse is permitted only after cleanup is durable and only with a
  CREATE_BRANCH target token exactly one greater than the DELETED token;
  delayed metadata, retention mutations, and requests from an older
  incarnation are rejected.  The existing page, forkmeta, WAL, and layer
  formats remain unchanged: the durable DELETED event is the cutover proof
  that all old-incarnation consumers and writers have drained before reuse;
- before a numeric timeline ID becomes reusable, deletion purges every
  shard-local page/fork/WAL index and materialized-page cache entry for the old
  incarnation (or those runtime keys include the incarnation); tests reuse the
  ID immediately with identical relation keys and horizons without restarting;
- retention owner IDs carry an incarnation token allocated from one named,
  durable controller allocation domain.  Tokens are globally monotonic within
  that domain, are carried by every SET/DROP and durable owner record, and are
  never inferred from a per-owner generation.  Authoritative
  DROP durably closes that incarnation; after every operation admitted under it
  has drained, its generation tombstone may be folded into a bounded allocation-
  domain frontier even past lower live tokens.  Every live or undrained token at
  or below that frontier remains an explicit durable exception.  Allocation
  must durably reserve that exception before returning a token to its caller,
  or frontier advancement must be capped by a controller-published safe
  allocation watermark.  Each reservation carries a durable, idempotent
  allocation-operation identity before token delivery.  On retry or startup,
  the controller either returns the same token or durably closes an
  undelivered reservation after proving no caller can possess it; fault tests
  cover crashes before reservation, after reservation, and during token
  delivery so interrupted allocations cannot accumulate permanent live
  exceptions.  Exceptions persist a live/closed state: only a live
  exception admits SET/DROP, while a closed exception rejects all new mutations
  but remains until already-admitted operations drain.  Removing it then makes the
  already-advanced frontier reject delayed mutations.  Thus metadata is bounded
  by active/undrained owners rather than historical reader churn.  Reuse
  requires a higher owner incarnation.  Deleting a timeline incarnation may
  reclaim all of its owner records while retaining the timeline-incarnation
  fence;
- crash-safe checkpoint/compaction of the shared timeline-state log, retaining
  each slot's current state and maximum incarnation while bounding startup
  replay;
- a timeline-state append cutover lock or frozen-sequence plus tail-handoff
  protocol, so concurrent create/delete/incarnation events acknowledged during
  checkpoint publication are present exactly once in either the replacement or
  its durable tail;
- inspection reports pending and failed cleanup.

Acceptance:

- unsafe deletes fail before mutation;
- every fault boundary leaves the timeline either fully readable or durably
  deleting/deleted;
- repeated delete requests are idempotent;
- repeated delete/recreate cycles reuse the bounded ID space without aliasing
  an older incarnation, including across daemon restart;
- repeated provision/drop churn on one long-lived timeline keeps owner metadata
  bounded and rejects delayed SET/DROP from every folded owner incarnation;
- concurrent timeline transitions at every state-log publication crash boundary
  reopen with no lost state or incarnation event;
- deleting a branch does not affect its parent or siblings.

Expected scope: one or two PRs.

### R6. Prove bounded space

Status: **soak in CI and scheduled nightly; every persisted category the
soak's owner mix exercises is proven bounded on CI-sized and 6000/8000-round
runs, the operational cutoff no longer needs a page-history owner, and
SLRU-class and reader-artifact versions follow the relation plan. The artifact
lifecycle follow-up adds completion intervals and durable drop
events, so dropped objects' last data generations can be reclaimed after their
retained dependencies disappear. Small lifecycle metadata tombstones remain;
the fixed-key soak is not a proof of bounded metadata for unbounded distinct
keys. See `ARTIFACT_LIFECYCLE.md` for the protocol and deterministic validation**.

`pagestore_soak_test` is the acceptance harness.  It plays every retention
role over the daemon protocol: a WAL-shipping writer with a bounded live set
(update, extend, truncate, unlink/recreate), a materializer that mirrors
control note/image pairs, publishes durable WAL-index progress, and advances
an exact `(LSN, admission_seq)` owner pin, an advancing and a fixed reader
whose pinned views are verified by as-of reads and sizes, copy-on-write
branches that are written, read for fork-point isolation, durably deleted, and
reused by incarnation, and clean/crash daemon restarts with full-model
re-verification.  Physical bytes are sampled per persisted category against
declared during-run and quiescent bounds derived from the controller
configuration, and the report carries logical/physical bytes, approximate
write amplification, per-controller lag, throttle and wait time, catch-up
time, and active owners.  Bugs it exposed and the fixes that landed with it:
control-image/note pairs are now pruned like relation pages but fenced by every
retained WAL boundary and planned over the complete version chain
(`pagestore_control_prune_test`); WAL-index compaction takes durable stored
page versions and fork-level deaths as replacement bases
(`ps_walidx_prune_plan_bases`, reclaim core cases); and forkmeta snapshot
compaction exempts frontier-less branch timelines instead of failing closed
for every timeline, capping the cutoff at each live branch's fork point so
its own lower-LSN mutations stay admissible, while reclaim-debt accounting
stays strict.  Control-image retention also fences every retained SLRU seed
and reader artifact, keeps one physical copy per retained version across
mirror retries, and is rescheduled whenever a WAL-resource pin or a deleted
branch cap changes; single-page redo starts from the stored replacement base
when the WAL index no longer carries a full-page image.  Longer runs
then exposed unbounded fork-lifecycle history: image compaction now drops
page versions invalidated at every horizon they serve, the forkmeta planner
keeps only the base, inheritance fence, and growth per horizon plus the
definitive events a retained version or a still-indexed WAL record needs, and
deletion-forced generations compact survivors whenever a cutoff is proven
(`pagestore_lifecycle_prune_test`, `ps_forkmeta_prune_plan_required`).

Add a deterministic soak scenario with bounded live data but repeated updates,
WAL generation, compaction, reader advancement, branch creation/deletion, and
daemon restart.

Acceptance:

- page history, shipped WAL, WAL index, and deleted-timeline debris each remain
  within a declared bound while the workload continues;
- the append-only shared `forkmeta` log is compacted/reclaimed and its physical
  bytes are included in the declared bound;
- retention owner/tombstone metadata and the timeline-state log remain within
  declared bounds across repeated owner and timeline incarnations;
- each reclaimer has a declared maximum lag/catch-up interval, and controller
  backpressure bounds foreground admission when maintenance exceeds it;
- the report includes logical live bytes, physical bytes, write amplification,
  per-category GC lag/catch-up time, backpressure time, and active retention
  owners;
- retained SQL-visible state remains correct throughout the run.

The operational cutoff is now derived from what the writing compute already
publishes (the materializer's WAL/WAL-index pin at its restart redo, or the
newest checkpoint note's redo for a direct-write compute), so a materializer-only or
branch-compute topology prunes page history and control images without a
page-history owner; the branch controller's base pin carries page history
while a branch is prepared, and a kept checkpoint image retains its
exact-redo twin.

The materializer's own WAL-index horizon is page-protected by the cutoff
derived from its pin, so stored pages replace its FPI-led chains.  Two
2026-09-13/14 nightly dispatches (runs 34747373574, 34825221247) failed seed
20260909's `wal` bound by a few KiB; the cause is explained and fixed: the
reclaimer's raw WAL-index dependency floor only moved at a WAL-index
controller-forced publication (~1000 rounds here) with nothing requesting one
on the reclaimer's own behalf, and its one-second no-progress backoff was not
cancelled by the publication that unblocked it.  `wal_segment_reclaim_one` now
requests an on-demand, fence-keyed compacted WAL-index publication for a
segment blocked only by that stale floor (re-issued only on a raw-floor or
retention-registry fence change, not on every durable progress op, which the
backend materializer publishes once per indexing batch and which alone can
never retire the blocking item), and the backoff is cancelled by a
proof-epoch bump on every event that can move a proof input, rate limited to
a 20 ms floor so a retention pin drop -- dispatched without the admission
lock -- cannot turn drop-heavy churn into a drain storm.  Independent review
of the first version of this fix found and fixed a lost-wakeup ordering bug
(the backoff must record the epoch read before this attempt's own proof
inputs, not a fresh read at arm time, which can race with exactly that
unlocked drop window) and the progress-keyed over-triggering above.  The
soak's `wal` bound is restated from five declared terms (18 KiB tighter) with
a per-sample check tying physical WAL to the soak's own fences, reporting the
observed margin as `wal_fence_slack_max` (expected up to roughly 2.1 MiB:
1 MiB alignment, 1 MiB for one fully proven segment awaiting
publication+GC+the 20 ms floor+reclaim, and ~130-200 KiB of raw items pinned
below a held reader's or branch's horizon).  A second review round closed two
more gaps: WAL_INDEX-only pin changes now also bump the reclaimer's proof and
fence epochs (they were previously fenced by the compaction plan but not
wired into either epoch, since the pin-mutation sites gated the bump on
PAGE_HISTORY/WAL resources only), and the request's
`walidx_snapshot_end[tl] < progress` guard was removed, since a fence change
can make the plan drop more at the very same durable-progress-covered
end_lsn a prior publication already reached.  Seed 20260909 at 8000 rounds
now peaks at ~1.7-1.8 MiB, stable across CPU regimes.
Resolved (2026-09-20): two residuals left after the fix above were closed --
(1) a replacement base or full-page-image item that becomes durable/arrives
with no retention-registry fence change at all was left to the WAL-index
controller's own trigger; the reclaimer now arms a watch on the specific
blocking page at every fruitless evaluation and keys the request on
retirement evidence computed over two separate windows: a nearer protected
horizon P (page-history/walidx fence) accepts a durable base or a newer
FPI in [item end, P], while the farther unprotected durable-progress
horizon U needs a newer FPI in [item end, U] specifically, since
retain_chain applies its base-or-FPI-vs-FPI-only rule per horizon, not
once for whichever horizon happens to be nearest.  A flush or index add
that changes either window's evidence wakes the watch within the 20 ms
floor -- only while that window has not already found what it needs, so
an already-satisfied window cannot be re-triggered by every later,
unrelated flush of the same shard -- and the next evaluation (<= 1 s idle)
catches any change that arrived without a wake; a request is not re-issued
while both windows and the raw floor/fence epoch are unchanged (a
watched-item count change from a partial retirement is a bounded
exception: one extra fruitless re-request, not a repeat).  (2)
control-image/note pruning is scheduled on every retention change but
executes only at the next shard compaction, which reads image layers only:
a superseded control note that is still memtable-resident is invisible to
it, so the WAL retention floor it sets could trail a fence release by up to
2 MiB of control-shard page writes (the default `flush_pages`) instead of
one compaction pass; the reclaimer now requests a flush of the control
shard when the retention floor's note term alone holds a segment boundary
and the note that sets it is superseded -- below the PAGE_HISTORY effective
floor and not the newest note at or below any control-note prune fence --
keyed on (note lsn, admission_seq, fence_epoch) so an unchanged decision is
never re-issued, and marks the shard's page-prune-due flag only together
with that flush request; a layer-resident superseded note is left to the
due mark the fence change already set.  Neither residual is exercised by
the soak's own workload, so its acceptance bounds are unchanged; see the
new reclaim-core test cases below.  A follow-up review (also 2026-09-20,
see the 2026-09-20 progress-log row below) found each of these two fixes
had a design gap and closed both, plus three lower-severity issues, on the
same branch before it shipped.  A second review pass (also 2026-09-20, see
MVP_STATUS.md's second 2026-09-20 progress note) found the residual-1 watch's
single-window (h_cap) evidence approximation missed the ordinary
production case of a protected fence nearer than progress -- described
above, in the two-window language that replaces the exactness claim the
single-window design could not actually meet -- and closed it too.
Nothing remains before the gate closes beyond keeping the nightly soak
green.

The nightly long-run configuration is `.github/workflows/pagestore-nightly.yml`
(three seeds, 8000 rounds each, scheduled daily and dispatchable with chosen
seeds/rounds; reports summarized per job and retained as artifacts).  The
schedule fires only once the workflow file is on the repository's default
branch, which GitHub requires for `schedule` and `workflow_dispatch`.

Expected scope: one PR.  Passing it closes the retention MVP gate.

### R5b. Add reclaimer backpressure controllers

Status: **R5b controllers complete for PAGE, shipped-WAL, WAL-index, and
forkmeta; queue-bound soak/tuning remains R6 work**.

R5b-1 adds lean independent PAGE and shipped-WAL lag controllers.  They publish
high-water/catch-up configuration, hysteretic throttle state, transitions, and
foreground wait time; POSIX foreground mutations wait before entering runtime
locks, while reads and maintenance continue.  PAGE debt is limited to complete
flush-covered segments, and WAL debt uses the existing retention, raw
dependency, and branch proofs.  R5b-2 adds an independent POSIX WAL-index
controller whose debt is the saturating sum of append tails, obsolete
epoch/watermark bytes, and obsolete snapshot generations.  Its bounded
metadata-only refresh validates selected manifest/shard identity while
immutable payload checksums remain a startup/publication responsibility, and
per-timeline tail candidates can force fair snapshot publication below the
geometric trigger.  Forkmeta adds a POSIX-only compacted-source baseline plus
append growth and obsolete snapshot/temp debris, with bounded metadata
observation and forced fair snapshot maintenance.  Queue-bound soak evidence
and controller-specific tuning remain follow-up work in R6; forkmeta does not
include any forkmeta-index or H0 changes.

Expected scope: one or two PRs.  R6 consumes these controls; it does not
introduce them.

## Crash and compatibility work

### H0. Add common fault and inspection primitives

Status: **read-only aggregate, per-timeline, and minimal relation inspection
foundation complete; composed H1 scenarios remain**.

The first H0 slice uses one canonical fault catalog for C and Python, proves a
pre-armed daemon fault was reached, and checks two recovery opens.  Existing
page-compaction, GC mark-delete, page-frontier, and WAL-index-frontier crash
windows use the same registry.  The lock-free `daemon.after_ready` point also
supports error and bounded pause actions, with real crash/error/pause daemon
recovery scenarios.  H0b now supplies bounded seqlock snapshots and the strict,
read-only `private-test-ipc` inspection schema v4 contract for aggregate health,
manifest, GC, owners, backpressure, and pruning observations plus the
per-timeline foundation, including runtime probing of every advertised operation
and strict
boolean/nonnegative-counter response typing.  Runtime profiles now advertise
protocol version 45 and schema version 4.  The minimal H1 relation operation
uses a dedicated request/response slot isolated from ordinary I/O channels,
with daemon-instance/generation/deadline fencing, strict read-only opcode and
parameter validation, expected timeline-incarnation fencing, as-of
existence/fork-size results, and explicit `selected_version: null` when the
core cannot prove one aggregate version.  The relation mailbox is advertised
only by the POSIX frontend; standalone relation assertions are capability-gated
so the SPDK frontend remains runnable without that POSIX-only mailbox.
The first composed H1 materializer slice is now implemented: the two
restartpoint plans pause the checkpointer child after relation-page sync/before
marker write and after marker sync, then stop and recover the whole
materializer.  The prepared-receipt/service-restore branch slice and the POSIX
image-layer create/write/seal/manifest-ADD publication slice are also covered.
Portable bootstrap/install is covered by the golden scenario's installer
crash/retry matrix. Manifest replacement, reclaim, and GC H1 cases remain.

Deliverables:

- one test-only named fault registry with crash/error/pause actions and hit
  counts;
- reachability accounting so an unhit expected fault fails the test;
- harness timeouts, replay metadata, and diagnostic bundles;
- bounded shared-memory snapshots plus a strict read-only `private-test-ipc`
  inspection schema and capability advertisement for timeline, relation,
  manifest/layer, retention/GC, and owner state needed by recovery assertions;
  mutating inspection operations remain empty.  Relation requests use a
  dedicated inspection mailbox and never claim ordinary I/O channels.

Acceptance:

- faults do not add durability edges or alter production behavior when disabled;
- every run reports scenario, seed, fault, hit count, and operation identity;
- paused faults have a watchdog and actionable diagnostics.
- the H0b Python harness tests validate every advertised inspection operation
  and its exact response fields, and reject extra or mutating schema entries.

Expected scope: one or two PRs.

### Local POSIX store ownership and orphan-layer recovery

Store recovery and local provider mutations share an exclusive advisory store
lease. Startup may remove canonical, unreferenced local layer files only after
validating the manifest and the complete candidate namespace. Manifest-owned
IDs, including deleting and remote-only records, remain protected. Unknown
non-layer files and object-tier artifacts are not part of this sweep.

Ambiguous manifest-tail repair must durably inhibit orphan sweeping before
truncating the manifest, and the inhibition persists across restart. Missing
manifest metadata does not authorize deletion. Recovery retries must preserve
referenced data after partial unlink or directory-sync failures.

Acceptance includes competing owners with distinct SHM names, release after
process death, failed-open cleanup, canonical orphan reclamation, namespace
validation before deletion, and continued H1 sentinel recovery. This closes
local orphan cleanup only; the other H1 crash families and R6 space acceptance
remain separate gates.

### H1. Compose process-level crash scenarios

Status: **materializer replay/restartpoint, branch prepared-receipt/service-
restore, portable bootstrap/install, POSIX image-layer publication, POSIX
page-pruning, POSIX WAL-index compaction, POSIX WAL reclaim, POSIX timeline
deletion, POSIX manifest replacement, POSIX fork-metadata publication, and
writer/reader/materializer/store restart-combination slices implemented;
branch-compute restarts remain with the golden scenario**.

Required scenario families:

- materializer replay/restartpoint/durable-marker publication;
- branch prepare, receipt publication, bootstrap install, and service restore;
- manifest replacement and image-layer seal/publication;
- page pruning, WAL reclaim, WAL-index compaction, remote upload intent and
  orphan reconciliation, and timeline deletion;
- daemon, writer, materializer, and branch-compute restart combinations.

The portable install slice in `mvp_golden_test.sh` targets an offline same-build,
default-tablespace skeleton. Four named installer-backend aborts cover maps
installed, the pg_xact remove/rename gap, and both sides of final manifest
publication. Each case checks the exact fault report and backend exit,
unchanged prepared inputs and restored control, startup rejection before
publication, full artifact recovery on retry, and byte-idempotent reinstall.
The resulting branch must pass golden SQL fork-point, parent/child isolation,
and restart checks. Power-loss recovery and concurrent installers/service
managers are outside this process-abort contract.

The materializer slice is split into two focused plans: one pauses after
relation-page store sync and before marker write, and one pauses after marker
store sync and before retention advance.  The pause is reported by the named
fault machinery, while the harness immediately stops the complete materializer
postmaster and lets the supervisor recover it; it does not assume that the
checkpointer child is the supervisor's worker generation.  Each plan records
both R1 and R2 relation metadata and requires the R2 main fork to grow.

The page-pruning slice adds a `gc_seed` runtime operation to the daemon fault
harness.  A dedicated IPC client seeds three generations of relation history
and a newer block, arms the named fault marker, then installs a configured
page-history owner at the cutoff; three process-abort scenarios crash after
the durable page-prune frontier, after the compacted layer's manifest
publication, and after the retired layer's mark-delete.  The snapshot, recovery
read (published newest block, retained history at the cutoff, refused
pre-cutoff version), manifest/local-layer reconciliation, and republished
retained horizon are checked, followed by one idempotent restart.

The WAL-index compaction slice reuses `gc_seed` with a `wal_index` workload:
a fixed WAL-index reader at 40 under three FPI-led chains on one block, one
committed interval made a snapshot candidate by `--walidx-snapshot-bytes 1`,
and a process abort after the durable frontier.  The crash must leave the
frontier plus the staged generation without its commit; recovery must commit
the retried generation, serve the reader's exact chain and the newest chain,
refuse the dropped point below the frontier, and keep the WAL-index owner.

The WAL reclaim slice adds three named store-lock probes to the shipped-WAL
prefix reclaim (`wal_reclaim.before_unlink`, `wal_reclaim.after_unlink`,
`wal_reclaim.before_dir_fsync`) beside the existing environment hooks the
core/store unit tests use, and a `wal_reclaim` gc_seed workload: three sealed
1 MiB segments, a control note at the shipped end, workload-armed fault, and
WAL-index progress through the end.  Snapshots count the sealed segments left
on disk per stage; recovery must finish the unlink retry, refuse prefix reads,
keep the WAL end and retain floor, clear physical reclaim debt, and leave no
owner.

The timeline deletion slice adds four lock-held probes
(`timeline_delete.after_deleting`, `.after_wal_cleanup`,
`.after_segment_rewrite`, `.after_deleted`) around the durable DELETING event,
private WAL/WAL-index removal, shared segment rewrite, and the durable DELETED
event (2026-09-20: the segment-rewrite probe was replaced by
`.mid_segment_tombstone` and `.after_segment_tombstone` when the rewrite
itself was replaced by in-place tombstoning -- see the F3/Q1 progress row),
and a `timeline_delete` gc_seed workload: a branch with private shipped
WAL, a committed WAL-index interval, an owner layer, and shared-segment pages,
then a workload-armed BEGIN_DELETE.  Snapshots check the owner's private
artifacts per stage; recovery must reach DELETED with its incarnation token,
keep the parent readable, reject branch reads, remove every owner artifact,
reconcile the manifest, and register no owner.

The manifest replacement slice adds two map-held probes around the atomic
`layers.manifest` rewrite (`manifest_compact.after_tmp_sync`,
`manifest_compact.after_rename`), removes a crashed compaction's temp log on
manifest open, and adds a `manifest_compact` gc_seed workload that writes 320
pages under a harness-held maintenance pause (`--test-maintenance-pause-file`)
before arming the fault and releasing maintenance.  Snapshots check the temp
file per stage; recovery must replay to a reconciled manifest, serve every
page, and leave no temp log.

The restart-combination slice adds a `restart` operation to the writer and
materializer runtimes.  Writer-runtime targets are the writer and installed
pinned readers (a reader restart restores its boot control image with
`pagestore_control_restore` first); materializer-runtime targets are the
writer, the materializer worker (replaced by the supervisor with a new
generation), and the store (supervisor and computes stopped, daemon
restarted on the same shared memory, computes and supervisor returned).
`writer_reader_restart` and `materializer_restart_combinations` compose
them with horizon, visibility, boundary, and zero-lag assertions.

The fork-metadata slice composes the existing `forkmeta.*` probes on the
daemon through a `forkmeta` gc_seed workload: the page-pruning history and
cutoff pin prove the cutoff, thirty-two relations carry persisted fork-size
events on both sides of it, and a post-cutoff trickle publishes the second
generation that retires the first.  This covers the R4b acceptance item that
H1 exercise each publication boundary in a composed process-crash scenario,
and the trickle relations are in the oracle through the acknowledged-append
ledger, so the concurrent-mutation clause is closed at every boundary.

Acceptance:

- each declared transition is exercised before and after its durability point;
- recovery yields the complete old state only for crashes before durability
  and the complete new state for crashes after durability; acknowledged
  markers, deletion states, reclamation frontiers, and branch publications are
  monotonic and cannot roll back even when they are not SQL-visible;
- direct and recovered SQL-visible results agree at declared horizons.

Expected scope: two or three focused PRs.

### H2. Add persisted-format fixtures and compatibility CI

Status: **daemon-side POSIX record formats covered under D5 rule 2,
including legacy fixtures exercised by each format change; rule 3's
container obligations met for the POSIX and SPDK container identities and
a fail-closed, durably published SPDK superblock; rule 1's payload-identity
binding done for the paths that hand bytes to PostgreSQL (the shipped-WAL
envelope and restore command, the control image's WAL segment size, the
page and relation-map paths PostgreSQL's own loaders already verify, and
the SLRU seed pages on every seeding path) with the seeders' replay proven
against recovery's; rule 4's store-object families done (the backend's
object payloads have their identities in `pagestore_artifact_format.h`,
the raw values carry an identity trailer, and `posix-backend-objects` is
the current fixture) and its backend data-directory artifacts done (the
prepared branch and reader files and the two raw-value markers have their
identities in the same header, the markers carry an identity trailer, and
`pgdata-artifacts` is their fixture, loaded through the backend's own
loaders) and the controller's and supervisor's JSON files done (their
layouts live in `pagestore_artifact_schema.py`, every one carries a
schema member and the ones a later run relies on a checksum, and
`controller-json` is their fixture).  H2 is complete.**

The controller's and supervisor's JSON.  `pagestore_branch_prepare`
persists its configuration (schema 2), its crash journal
`pagestore_branch.prepare.json` (schema 2 with `crc32`; schema 1, a
receipt without the prepared-manifest identity, is refused by name) and
its retention generation authority `branch-retention-generation-<id>.json`
(schema 2 with `crc32`; 1 read as legacy); `pagestore_materializer_supervisor`
its configuration (schema 4), `status.json` (schema 3 with `crc32`; 2 and a
status without the member read as legacy) and the materializer's retention
generation authority `retention-owner-<id>.json` (schema 1 with `crc32`;
the original, without the member, read as legacy), which the controller
reads too.  `pagestore_artifact_schema.py`, installed beside both tools,
holds each kind's schema, accepted and refused schemas, checksum rule and
key set; both tools stamp what they write and judge what they read through
it, so an unknown schema, a missing or wrong checksum or a member the
layout does not define fails closed before the tool interprets a value,
and `--identities` prints the table the fixture pins.  The fixture
`controller-json` holds what real runs left behind -- the golden scenario
captures the controller's three files, the managed materializer smoke the
supervisor's three -- and `harness/pagestore_controller_fixture.py --check`
(Python only, so the standalone lane runs it) holds the identities to it,
loads every artifact, and applies forty mutations: an unknown or null
schema, a file that is not JSON, an unknown member, a wrong or missing
checksum and a member edited under a stale one are refused; each legacy
layout is accepted; the journal's schema 1 is refused.  The legacy and
refused schemas come from the fixture's own identity table, not from the
reader under test, so a reader that drops a legacy schema fails the
check rather than shrinking it.

Data-directory artifacts.  The files a compute leaves for another to load
-- the prepared branch's `pagestore_branch.manifest` (JSON, format 2; 1
read as legacy) and `pagestore_branch.bootstrap` ("PSBB" v1, CRC-bound to
the manifest text), the prepared reader's `pagestore_reader.manifest`
(JSON, format 3; 2 legacy), `pagestore_reader.snapshot` (the reader
snapshot object's layout) and `pagestore_reader.catalog` ("PSCP" v1), the
reader's relation-map intent marker `.pagestore-reader-map-pending` and
the SLRU mirror's continuity marker `pagestore.slru_mirror_primed` -- have
their names, layouts and identities in `pagestore_artifact_format.h`,
pinned field by field to the backend's structs, and are reported by
`pagestore_format_versions` as the `pgdata` family.  The two markers were
bare values (a horizon, a checkpoint redo); they keep the value at 0 and
gain the identity trailer at 8, a legacy 8-byte (or, for the primed
marker, empty) one still reads, and one naming another identity fails
closed: the reader refuses to adopt the map next to it, and the mirror
reads it as debt.  `pagestore_pgdata_artifact_check()` loads one artifact
through the loader a compute uses and reports its identity, so
`harness/pagestore_pgdata_fixture.py --check --build` can start a scratch
cluster of the checking build, load every artifact of the fixture and
require the loaders to refuse twenty-one declared mutations (a flipped
header, map or xid byte, a truncation, a bumped format, an edited manifest
member, a bootstrap whose manifest no longer matches its CRC, a marker
with a foreign trailer; a legacy marker is accepted).  The fixture is
captured from a real backend: `integration_test.sh` copies the prepared
branch and reader it made into `$PAGESTORE_PGDATA_FIXTURE_CAPTURE` with
the identity each loader binds them to, and has the backend publish the
two markers there (`pagestore_pgdata_marker_write()`), since a live
cluster removes the intent on adoption and renews the stamp at every
checkpoint.  Without a PostgreSQL build the check holds only the compiled
identities to the fixture (the standalone lane); the integration lane
runs the loaders.

Payload identity, per path.  The shipped-WAL envelope (`walv1_*` header
version 2) records the payload's own identity from the WAL page header it
begins with -- `xlp_magic`, which PostgreSQL bumps with every WAL format
change, `xlp_info`, and the cluster's WAL segment size from a long page
header -- in the eight bytes version 1 reserved, so no offset moves and a
version-1 envelope still decodes as one that recorded nothing.  The page
header fields are read in host byte order, as PostgreSQL wrote them, and
the long header's segment size where the writer's ABI put it (the store
recognizes the 8-byte- and 4-byte-aligned layouts by their contents).  The
store copies the values and re-derives them from the payload's first chunk
once per open before serving any range of a segment, interior ranges
included: an envelope whose recorded identity is not what its payload
carries fails the read, whatever the chunk hashes say about the bytes.
`pagestore_walrestore` is the loader, built with the PostgreSQL headers so
it reads the page header with this build's `XLogLongPageHeaderData`.  Before
it turns a segment name into an LSN it reads the timeline's newest mirrored
control image and requires its `xlog_seg_size` to be `--segsize` -- a size
the cluster was not initialized with maps the name to a range the store
legitimately has nothing at, which would otherwise read as an archive miss
-- and before handing a reconstructed segment to recovery it requires
`xlp_magic` to be this build's `XLOG_PAGE_MAGIC`, `xlp_xlog_blcksz` to be
its `XLOG_BLCKSZ`, the long page header's `xlp_seg_size` to be that same
size, `xlp_sysid` to be the control image's system identifier, and
`xlp_pageaddr` to be the segment start the name maps to -- the checks
`XLogReaderValidatePageHeader()` would make next, whose failure outside
standby mode ends recovery quietly.  A mismatch, and a store that refuses
the read (a
corrupt or resealed segment, WAL reclaimed below the frontier, a fenced
incarnation), exits with a status above 125, which `RestoreArchivedFile()`
treats as fatal to recovery -- any other nonzero status means "no such
archive file" and would end recovery quietly -- and names the cause on
stderr.  `pagestore_control_restore --payload-identity` prints the build's
tuple (version constants and layout parameters) so the fixture check can
ask whether a fixture's payload is loadable by the checking build
(`--postgres-payload-identity-tool`; the identity includes where the
build's `XLogLongPageHeaderData` puts the segment size and the build's WAL
block size, so a fixture captured under the other ABI or another
`--with-wal-blocksize` is foreign too, and a capture stamps its shipped WAL
with the capturing build's magic and block size so a release branch can
capture the fixture that matches it): a current fixture captured
under another build is skipped as "payload needs a PostgreSQL build with
XLOG_PAGE_MAGIC ..." rather than failed as a broken envelope, and when no
current fixture matches the build the check fails on `pagestore`
(`--require-build-match`, which CI passes there) and warns elsewhere -- so
a release branch that has just received a format change is not left red,
carries the fixture captured under its own build once it captures one, and
recaptures rather than patches a `pagestore` fixture cherry-picked there.  The control image now also refuses
an image whose `xlog_seg_size` differs from the target cluster's own
`pg_control`.  Relation pages need no envelope field: PostgreSQL verifies
`pd_pagesize_version` (`BLCKSZ | PG_PAGE_LAYOUT_VERSION`) on every page the
buffer manager reads through smgr, uninitialized pages excepted, and the
relation maps the reader and branch bootstrap install are read by
`load_relmap_file`, which checks `RELMAPPER_FILEMAGIC` and the map CRC.
SLRU pages carry no native identity and are bound by the control tuple
alone.  The fixture `posix-wal-payload-identity` is current: its shipped
WAL begins with a genuine long page header, `fixture.json` records the
payload identity the archive carries, the check verifies every version-2
envelope against its payload, and a `wal_segment.payload_identity` mutation
(a resealed envelope naming another magic) is use-rejected.

The slice adds `pagestore_format.h` identities reported by every format-owning
module, the `pagestore_format_versions` tool, the `fixture` workload of
`pagestore_gc_crash_client`, `harness/pagestore_fixture.py` (capture and
check), and `fixtures/posix-mvp-baseline`.  The check enforces identity
freshness, reopen with the oracle across a restart, and thirty-six declared
mutations with their documented outcomes.  It surfaced and fixed two defects
(relocated stores refused by absolute layer locations; a damaged forkmeta
marker discarding acknowledged post-cutover events).  The gap it documented
(forkmeta source records had no checksum) is closed by FKM3 records, the
same 64-byte layout with a CRC-24 in the former pad bytes; FKM2 stays
readable and its fixture is the legacy one.

Fixture families:

- timeline metadata and retention registry;
- manifest and image/delta layer headers/indexes;
- page segments, shipped WAL metadata, and WAL index;
- control, SLRU, reader, branch-bootstrap, and fork-metadata artifacts.  The
  forkmeta checkpoint/tail format is checksummed; fixtures cover legacy reopen
  or migration, truncation, and corruption of a structurally complete record;

Acceptance:

- supported old fixtures reopen or upgrade to the documented state;
- unsupported newer/unknown versions fail closed with an actionable error;
- checksum corruption and illegal truncation are rejected;
- every persisted-format change must update or add a fixture.

Expected scope: one or two PRs.  Passing it with H1 closes the crash/compatibility
MVP gate.

## Work that follows the MVP

These items matter, but should not delay the two remaining MVP gates unless
measurement proves they block the acceptance scenarios:

- user-tablespace portable branch bootstrap;
- materializer PGDATA provisioning and service-manager integration;
- object-tier cache budget/residency;
- production S3 provider;
- sparse image indexes and a separate layer-block cache;
- immutable WAL delta sealing and bounded redo-chain compaction;
- cost-aware materialized-page cache admission and proven redo avoidance;
- size-tiered/incremental compaction, key-range pruning, and bloom filters;
- per-shard manifest/layer map/cache and replicated timeline metadata;
- asynchronous POSIX I/O and explicit CPU/IO scheduling;
- SPDK image-layer recovery/GC;
- production backup/restore, observability, alerting, and repair procedures.

## Decisions for discussion

Record the selected answer and rationale here before implementing the dependent
work.

### D1. Owner identity authority

Selected: deployment/controller-assigned stable 64-bit owner ID plus a
monotonic generation stored in controller state and carried on every durable
SET/DROP.  The retention registry stores the maximum generation, including as
a durable non-enumerable tombstone after DROP, and rejects stale or
same-generation resurrection.  Delayed cleanup from an old supervisor therefore
cannot remove or resurrect its replacement's pin.  A replacement supervisor
updates the same owner key rather than adding another logical owner.

Alternative: derive identity from PGDATA or reader artifact.  This is easier to
bootstrap but makes cloning and deliberate replacement ambiguous.

Decision: **accepted 2026-08-12**.

The authority is a deployment/controller-assigned nonzero 64-bit `owner_id`
plus a monotonically increasing 32-bit `generation`, both durably stored by the
controller.  The key remains `(timeline, owner_kind, owner_id)`.  Generation 0
is reserved for retention records written by the pre-D1 protocol; a controller
starts at generation 1 and must fail rather than wrap.

The store persists the greatest observed generation, including after DROP.
SET/DROP below that generation return `PS_STATUS_STALE`; DROP leaves an
unenumerated tombstone, so a delayed request cannot resurrect or remove state
after restart or compaction.  SET at the current live generation may update the
horizon, and a greater generation atomically takes over the key.  For log
compatibility only, generation-0 SET-after-DROP retains the legacy unfenced
behavior until a generation-1 controller takes over the key.  The existing
materializer supervisor `owner_epoch` and `worker_generation` are local process
coordination fields, not this controller authority.

### D2. Owner release and stale-owner policy

Selected: ordinary process shutdown retains the durable pin.  Release requires
explicit authoritative deprovisioning or a safe durable horizon handoff;
generation replacement alone must quiesce the old runtime before its pin is
superseded.  Never use wall-clock lease expiry for correctness.  Stale owners
retain space until controller/operator reconciliation proves them dead.

Decision: **accepted 2026-08-12**.

Correctness never depends on wall-clock expiry.  A controller replacement
increments the durable generation only after quiescing the old consumer, then
atomically supersedes the old owner.
Crashes, timeouts, ambiguous failures, and ordinary supervisor handoff retain
the last pin.  DROP is reserved for explicit deprovision after consumption has
stopped; if that proof or the DROP acknowledgement is uncertain, the pin stays.

### D3. Shipped-WAL physical layout

Recommended: immutable fixed-size logical WAL segment files plus small durable
timeline metadata recording the retained base and append end.  Reclaim deletes
whole old files and retains the boundary file when needed.

Alternative: periodically rewrite the flat file.  It minimizes format count but
causes unbounded copy cost and a larger crash-publication protocol.

Decision: **accepted 2026-08-14**.  Use immutable fixed-size logical WAL
segments with checksummed metadata and bounded chunk validation.  The segment
store is integrated into daemon append/read/recovery with the flat log retained
as migration/tail authority.  The first R3b slice supplies the durable
retained-base metadata and monotonic publication primitive; later R3b slices
must add read pins, segment deletion, and reclamation of the corresponding
flat prefix.

### D4. Timeline deletion with descendants

Recommended for MVP: reject deletion while any descendant exists.  Do not add
cascade or ancestry reparenting semantics.

Decision: **accepted 2026-08-25**.  Reject deletion while any live or deleting
descendant exists; do not cascade or reparent.  The first lifecycle slice
implements this rule before durable transition publication.

### D5. Persisted-format support window

Decision: **accepted**, as the four rules below.  They separate what the page
store owns (its envelopes and containers) from what PostgreSQL owns (the bytes
inside them), because only the former can have a page-store support window.

1. **PostgreSQL-native payloads are wrapped, never rewritten.**  Relation
   pages (with their `pd_lsn`), the `ControlFileData` image, WAL segment
   bytes, SLRU pages, and `pg_filenode.map` contents are stored as the bytes
   PostgreSQL wrote and handed back to PostgreSQL code to load: pages to the
   buffer manager through smgr, the control image through
   `pagestore_control_restore`, WAL through the restore command, SLRUs and
   relation maps by installing the files.  The page store does not interpret
   a payload beyond the fields it needs to key and fence it (`pd_lsn`, the
   checkpoint redo, the segment start).  The rule binds the *persisted*
   payload: what the store holds is byte-exact.  Where an install step must
   derive a different PostgreSQL object from a stored one, that derivation
   is an explicit, named transformation on PostgreSQL's own definitions and
   never a second persisted format.  Two such steps exist today, and each
   fixture checks the stored input byte-exactly and the installed output
   against the named transformation, not for byte equality with the input:
   - the archive-bootstrap control install: after checking the control
     image's compatibility tuple against the running build,
     `pagestore_control_restore --archive-bootstrap` copies the stored
     `ControlFileData`, sets `minRecoveryPoint`/`minRecoveryPointTLI` to the
     checkpoint redo and its timeline, clears the backup start/end fields,
     recomputes the CRC with PostgreSQL's algorithm, and installs the
     result, so a fresh skeleton enters archive recovery at the stored
     checkpoint instead of trusting a foreign `initdb` state;
   - SLRU seeding for a branch (`pagestore_seed_clog`,
     `pagestore_seed_commit_ts`, `pagestore_seed_multixact`, driven by
     `pagestore_seed_branch_slrus()`): each page over the fork's horizon is
     the stored seed page at the base cutoff `C` with the shipped WAL in
     `(C, target]` applied, written as whole segments under `pg_xact`,
     `pg_commit_ts`, and `pg_multixact`.  The seed pages and the WAL bytes
     are PostgreSQL's, but the appliers are not: `ps_clog_apply_range()`
     and the commit-ts and multixact seeders decode the records and set
     the status bits, timestamps, and member slots themselves, mirroring
     `clog_redo`, `CommitTsRedo`, and `multixact_redo` rather than calling
     them.  That mirror is page-store-owned transformation logic: it is
     versioned with the envelope, bound to the PostgreSQL version whose
     redo it mirrors, and it must be proven equivalent to actual recovery
     by an independent result, not by a fixture that would only compare
     the mirror with itself.  That proof is the branch controller's
     `--verify-seed-against-materializer`: while the materializer is paused
     at the fork LSN `L` right after a restartpoint flushed its SLRUs --
     PostgreSQL recovery's own result for the same WAL through `L` -- the
     controller sets `pagestore.seed_reference_slru_dir` to the
     materializer's data directory, and every page the seeders reconstruct
     (base snapshot at `C` plus their replay of `(C, L]`) is compared byte
     for byte with the same page there before it is written; a difference,
     or a page the reference does not have, fails the preparation naming
     the SLRU, the page and the byte, and a preparation that seeded pages
     but compared none fails too.  Zero bootstrap pages an empty or
     segment-aligned horizon writes below its first live entry make no
     claim about recovery's state and are not compared.  The golden
     scenario runs with the flag, gives every SLRU real content before the
     fork (commit timestamps on, a two-member multixact), and requires
     reconstructed pages of `pg_xact`, `pg_commit_ts` and both
     `pg_multixact` halves to have been compared; the integration test
     drives the mismatch and missing-segment refusals with a forged
     reference.  Refactoring the appliers onto PostgreSQL's redo routines
     would retire the obligation.  The transformation is version checked
     on every path: `pagestore_seed_branch_slrus_impl()`, which the
     serialized controller, the public `pagestore_seed_branch_slrus()` and
     the legacy `pagestore_prepare_branch_impl()` all reach, resolves the
     mirrored control image at the base cutoff and refuses a cutoff with
     no image to bind to; the image's compatibility tuple is checked by
     `pagestore_control_image_compatible()` (the checks startup makes,
     plus `xlog_seg_size` against this cluster's) there and where the
     controller derives its horizons from the checkpoint image.
   A payload's version is therefore
   PostgreSQL's, and whether a payload can be loaded by a different
   PostgreSQL build is PostgreSQL's question, not a page-store migration.
   That identity is the full compatibility tuple PostgreSQL itself checks
   when it opens a cluster, not the version constants alone: a build with a
   different `BLCKSZ`, `XLOG_BLCKSZ`, `RELSEG_SIZE`, `SLRU_PAGES_PER_SEGMENT`,
   `MAXALIGN`, `NAMEDATALEN`, `INDEX_MAX_KEYS`, `TOAST_MAX_CHUNK_SIZE`,
   `LOBLKSIZE`, or float format writes incompatible page, WAL, and SLRU
   bytes under the same `PG_CONTROL_VERSION` and `CATALOG_VERSION_NO`, and
   a cluster initialized with another `--wal-segsize` names a different
   LSN range by the same segment file name.  The tuple is therefore the
   version constants (`PG_CONTROL_VERSION`, `CATALOG_VERSION_NO`,
   `XLOG_PAGE_MAGIC`, `RELMAPPER_FILEMAGIC`, `PG_PAGE_LAYOUT_VERSION`)
   together with the layout parameters `ControlFileData` records --
   those `pagestore_control_restore` already compares one by one, and
   `xlog_seg_size`, which it only checks for legality today and which the
   WAL restore path uses to turn a requested file name into an LSN range,
   so the WAL segment envelope binds the control image's `xlog_seg_size`
   and checks it against the `xlp_seg_size` of the long page header it
   carries and against the requesting cluster, as `xlogreader` itself
   rejects a mismatch.  Envelopes record that tuple for their payload,
   and a control-image reference covers only what `ControlFileData`
   contains: the control and catalog versions and the layout parameters.
   `XLOG_PAGE_MAGIC`, `RELMAPPER_FILEMAGIC`, and `PG_PAGE_LAYOUT_VERSION`
   live in the native headers of the WAL page, the relation map, and the
   relation page, so the envelope or loader that hands one of those
   payloads to PostgreSQL binds or checks that native identity as well
   (the WAL segment envelope against the first page header it carries, the
   relation-map envelope against the map's own magic, the page path
   against the page header) rather than relying on the control image.  A
   relation block that is still uninitialized is legitimately all zero
   (`PageIsNew()`: `pd_upper == 0`, `pd_pagesize_version == 0`), and the
   zero-extension path serves unwritten blocks that way, so the page-header
   check applies only to initialized pages; a new page carries no native
   identity and is bound by the control tuple alone.
   Loaders compare the tuple with the running build, and a mismatch fails
   closed naming the payload identity rather than the envelope.  Some
   object payloads are page-store-defined rather than PostgreSQL's, and
   those are versioned as envelopes: the reader's running-transaction
   snapshot (PostgreSQL has no stable serialization for it) and the raw
   values consumers `memcpy` out of an object -- the checkpoint-redo
   `XLogRecPtr` in control block 1 that the WAL retention floor derives
   from, the `PS_KLASS_SLRU_WM` watermark and the `PS_KLASS_SLRU_TOMB`
   truncation cutoff.  Those three keep their value at byte 0, where
   every reader finds it, and carry an identity trailer (magic and
   version) at byte 8, which a legacy object leaves zero: a zero trailer
   is accepted, a trailer naming another format or version is refused by
   the backend's readers and makes the daemon's WAL floor unknown (fail
   closed) rather than misread as a floor, a watermark, or a cutoff.
   Every such payload -- the three raw values, the materializer marker and
   release and writer checkpoint control blocks, and the five reader
   snapshot objects -- has its layout and identity in the shared
   `pagestore_artifact_format.h`, is reported by
   `pagestore_format_versions`, and is seeded by the fixture workload so
   the fixture carries one of each and the reopen oracle checks the store
   hands every one back intact (the reader objects with PostgreSQL's
   CRC-32C, which the freestanding header reproduces and
   `pagestore_control_restore --payload-identity` proves against
   `pg_crc32c` where both are linked).
2. **Envelopes -- the daemon's record formats -- keep a fixture for every
   version shipped on `pagestore` after the MVP baseline.**  A supported
   older version is readable or has an explicit migration; anything newer,
   unknown, checksum-corrupt, or illegally truncated fails closed with an
   actionable error.  Every format change updates or adds a fixture, and the
   compiled identities must match the committed fixture.  Release branches
   may define a narrower cross-major window.
3. **Containers are per provider, are registered separately from the
   records they hold, and carry the same support window as records.**  A
   record format is provider-neutral and one fixture proves it for every
   provider; a provider must not fork it.  Each provider registers the
   identity of its own container format -- the POSIX store's file naming
   and directory layout, the SPDK store's `spdk_super` (the two legacy struct
   images and the checksummed v2) and its on-device segment extent layout -- so a container
   change is caught by the identity check even where its fixture cannot
   run in CI, and rule 2 applies to it: a container shipped after the MVP
   baseline stays openable by a later release or migrates explicitly (as
   the V1 superblock already does), a change that would strand an earlier
   post-baseline store is not a compatible change, and the POSIX fixture
   keeps the earlier layout as a legacy fixture rather than being
   recaptured over it.  Registration is not the whole obligation.  A
   container whose metadata is unknown, newer, truncated, or corrupt must
   fail the open, never degrade to a default that can overwrite existing
   data; and the metadata a container depends on to place new data must be
   published durably -- written to a temporary file, fsynced, renamed over
   the old copy, the directory fsynced, with every failure propagated to
   the caller -- because a valid but stale copy that survives a lost write
   or crash reopens to the same overwrite.  The SPDK superblock now meets
   both (`pagestore_spdk_super.c`, a module without SPDK dependencies so
   the format is unit-tested and reported on every host): v2 is
   little-endian, length-prefixed and checksummed and records the shard
   count it was written for; the earlier sharded struct (version word 1)
   and single-shard struct (no version word) images are decoded and
   rewritten as v2 at the next publication; a truncated, foreign, newer,
   corrupt, differently sized, or differently sharded superblock refuses
   the open instead of restarting every shard at segment zero (the shard
   count is part of the extent layout, so a store recorded for N shards is
   never sliced or extended to another N, and a superblock longer than its
   layout is refused rather than read as a prefix); publication first
   flushes the NVMe namespace, so counts are never durable ahead of the
   extents they cover on a volatile write cache, then writes a temporary
   file, fsyncs, renames, fsyncs the directory, and returns any failure to
   `spdk_sync()`.  Both providers register their container identity: the
   POSIX directory layout and file naming as `posix_container`, and the
   SPDK superblock versions and the on-device extent layout as
   `spdk_container`.  The SPDK container fixture itself follows the MVP: it
   needs the device layout split from NVMe I/O behind a file-backed shim
   before it can be captured and checked without hardware.
4. **Backend-side artifacts follow rule 2 for their envelopes and rule 1
   for their payloads.**  Reader and branch manifests, the branch bootstrap,
   reader snapshot and catalog files, the reader's published snapshot
   objects, the materializer and writer control blocks, and the durable
   controller artifacts that recovery of an interrupted operation depends
   on -- the CRC-protected branch preparation journal
   (`pagestore_branch.prepare.json`), the branch retention-generation
   authority file that fences owner-generation reuse, the branch
   controller's configuration (loaded, schema-checked, and matched against
   the journal's configuration identity before an interrupted operation
   can be resumed), the reader-map intent marker
   (`.pagestore-reader-map-pending`, whose exact name and raw `XLogRecPtr`
   content restart recognizes to retry a relation-map installation that
   crashed before the pin advanced), the materializer
   supervisor's configuration, status, and its own generation-authority
   file (`retention-owner-<id>.json`, read independently of the status and
   published before a new worker generation is registered), and the SLRU
   mirror continuity
   markers (`pagestore.slru_mirror_debt`, and
   `pagestore.slru_mirror_primed` with its raw eight-byte checkpoint-redo
   stamp, whose presence and stamp decide at boot whether the stored SLRU
   mirror is complete or the cluster carries mirror debt) -- are page-store
   envelopes with
   a fixture and a support window of their own (their readers enforce
   exact schemas, so a schema change without a retained fixture and
   migration could leave a controller unable to resume or clean up, with
   the writer restricted, the materializer paused, or a pin stranded); the
   relation
   maps, SLRU pages, and control image they carry are PostgreSQL payloads
   whose version identity the envelope records and the loader checks.  A
   fixture whose payload names a different PostgreSQL version reports
   "payload needs PostgreSQL <version>" and is not treated as a broken
   envelope.

D5 note (2026-09-19): the reader snapshot's DATA object gained a second
`dbOid` partition -- a retention owner id instead of a real database Oid, for
the artifact an explicit exact-R publish produces, distinct from the
automatic checkpoint-driven snapshot's `dbOid = InvalidOid` -- after two
producers sharing one key silently collided in CI (RELEASE_VALIDATION.md's
"Integration-lane finding: a silent artifact key collision"). The manifest
could not reuse the same partitioning trick on the existing MANIFEST object:
that object's `dbOid` slot is already a namespace of real database OIDs (the
automatic per-database manifest, tracked and retired by the reader database
barrier), and an owner id equal to a live database's OID would alias it. The
explicit publish's manifest instead got a new, dedicated object,
`PS_READER_SNAPSHOT_OWNER_MANIFEST_OBJECT`, keyed by the owner id. Both
changes are store *address-space* partitions/additions, not envelope or
payload changes: the bytes at any of these keys are unchanged, so neither
bumped `PS_READER_SNAPSHOT_MANIFEST_FORMAT`/`PS_READER_SNAPSHOT_FORMAT` and
neither needed fixture regeneration (`fixtures/pgdata-artifacts` and
`fixtures/posix-artifact-lifecycle`, checked with `--require-build-match`,
both still pass unchanged). Rule 4's "reader's published snapshot objects"
now additionally means: one producer per key, with an owner id reserved for
exact-R rather than an automatic key's `InvalidOid` or the automatic
manifest's real-database-OID namespace.

Open follow-ups from this fix (R5-5, tracked in RELEASE_VALIDATION.md's
"Open follow-up work" section, not blocking): (a) an admission/storage
refusal inside `artifact_store_record()` poisons the whole daemon's artifact
path for the rest of its lifetime (`artifact_io_failed`), not just the one
request -- now visible as `PS_ARTIFACT_REFUSE_STORE_RECORD`/`POISONED`
instead of a bare -1, but the poisoning-on-one-refusal semantics need their
own review; (b) `append_page_impl`'s page-prune-frontier fence can refuse a
late-shipped SLRU/reader-snapshot artifact at or below the cutoff independent
of key/generation ordering -- a separate hazard from the collision fixed
here.

**Resolved 2026-09-20:** `append_page_impl()` returned the same `-1` for an
admission refusal (nothing durable changed) and a real storage failure
(bytes may be on disk); the lifecycle layer poisoned on either. Fix: a
`PsAppendOutcome` classifies every return site
(`append_page_raw_outcome()`); the lifecycle layer now poisons only on a
real I/O failure or a sync failure following an appended record, and every
other refusal returns a named, non-poisoning reason
(`PS_ARTIFACT_REFUSE_UNFENCED`/`_FORKMETA_CUTOFF`/`_SYNC`/`_LEGACY_BYPASS`/
`_IMMUTABLE_MISMATCH`, appended to the existing enum, no `PS_SHM_VERSION`
bump). (b) turned out not to be a separate hazard: the cutoff derivation
proves `cutoff <= frontier <= floor <= every active pin`, so a generation at
a pinned LSN is never below the cutoff -- the actual defect was that
`ps_artifact_begin` was not fence-checked at all, so a BEGIN at an unfenced
LSN was admitted pre-cutover (refused instead on its first WRITE) and
refused by the forkmeta growth check post-cutover, both misreported and both
poisoning under (a)'s bug. `ps_artifact_begin` now checks the same fence
predicate the data append uses (`artifact_lsn_fenced()`) before admitting a
new generation; the forkmeta growth check remains as defence in depth for
one theoretical structural gap and is now named
(`PS_ARTIFACT_REFUSE_FORKMETA_CUTOFF`). No producer clamping, no cutoff
derivation change. Tests: T1/T2/T4 in `pagestore_artifact_lifecycle_test.c`,
T5/T6 in `pagestore_forkmeta_cutover_test.c`, each fails on the pre-fix tree
and passes on this one. See `RELEASE_VALIDATION.md`'s R5-5 section for the
full derivation and `ARTIFACT_LIFECYCLE.md`'s "Refusals and failures" for
the resulting semantics.

The forkmeta orphaned-ordered-record adoption rule (`fork_event_adopt_orphaned_seg()`
and `fork_event_adopt_orphaned_commit_seg()`, PR fixing the PR #262 review
finding and its follow-up review findings F2/F3/F5/R2-F1) is not an envelope
migration under this decision: `ForkMetaRecV2`/FKM3 layout, kinds, and the
snapshot payload format are unchanged, and `pagestore_format_versions` reports
the same identities before and after.  It is a content-level recovery rule,
explicit and logged, not a silent tolerance of a new envelope shape, gated on
a stated proof (`fork_meta_orphan_proven()`: the selected forkmeta snapshot's
freeze sequence covers the record's admission sequence) that is NECESSARY but
not, by itself, SUFFICIENT proof against a torn append (finding R2-F1,
independent re-review): a refused record's admission sequence is still
observed to prevent identity reuse on retry, so a later cutover can freeze
past a torn record's sequence too, on any rescan after that cutover, not only
the one immediately following a crash.  The growth-class rule needs no
further proof (a torn growth append leaves no durable marker or in-memory
event at all, so it is sound unconditionally); the commit-class rule adds a
second, path-specific torn-exclusion proof on top of the freeze filter:
residency on the image-layer path (a layer-resident record's marker append
cannot still be in flight, since staging happens only after that append
returns) or, on the segment-suffix path, that at least one complete record
follows the unmatched record in the same segment (a torn body is always the
last complete record of its segment).  It is exercised by
`test_orphaned_ordered_marker_adopted()`,
`test_orphaned_ordered_marker_not_adopted_on_mismatch()`,
`test_orphaned_commit_marker_adopted()`,
`test_orphaned_commit_marker_segment_path()`,
`test_orphaned_commit_marker_segment_path_last_is_retired()`,
`test_orphaned_commit_marker_not_proven()`,
`test_orphaned_commit_marker_size_mismatch()`,
`test_torn_commit_append_never_adopted()` (folding in the reviewer's
standalone `torn_test.c` reproduction of R2-F1),
`test_torn_growth_append_never_adopted()`,
`test_deletion_filtered_forkmeta()` and its commit-shape variant
(`pagestore_forkmeta_cutover_test.c`), and by `integration_test.sh`'s
clean-shutdown reopen of its own retained store, which asserts the reopen
succeeds, that no segment tail was retired and no record was refused.
**Resolved (2026-09-20):** the root cause -- `page_cleanup_rewrite_segment()`
relocating survivors and rebasing the watermark -- is fixed by tombstoning in
place instead (`page_cleanup_tombstone_segment()`, invariant I3: segment
bytes are immutable once written, a record's `(seg_id, seg_off)` never
changes, the flush watermark never retreats).  `integration_test.sh`'s
adoption-count assertion is now a hard `== 0` invariant, not a detector, for
any store this daemon has ever fully owned.  See the D5 note below for the
persisted-format change this needed, and RELEASE_VALIDATION.md's "Resolved:
pruned ordered marker rescanned after a timeline-delete rewrite" for Q1 (the
worse, no-crash-required silent data loss the same root cause produced) and
the T7 follow-up (repair for a store that deleted a timeline before this fix
-- separate PR, not blocking).

D5 note (2026-09-20): timeline-delete tombstoning added three new
`page_segment` identities, `SEG_HOLE48_MAGIC`/`SEG_HOLE56_MAGIC`/
`SEG_HOLE64_MAGIC` ("SEH0"/"SEH1"/"SEH2"), one per existing record header
shape (48/56/64 bytes) -- the header size the hole must skip is carried by
the magic alone, matching the shape it replaces.  Only `SEG_HOLE56_MAGIC` and
`SEG_HOLE64_MAGIC` are registered as identities `pagestore_format_versions`
pins to a fixture: the daemon writes only admission-era records today
(56/64-byte headers), so `SEG_HOLE48_MAGIC` -- reachable only by tombstoning
a legacy 48-byte-header record, never produced by a live write -- stays a
readable format without a fixture requiring an instance of it, the same
precedent the pre-admission live magics above it already follow.

Following D5 rules 2-3, the format change demoted the fixture that shipped
at the pre-fix commit and added a new one rather than recapturing in place:
`fixtures/posix-artifact-lifecycle` (the format that shipped before this PR)
now carries `role: legacy` with its tarball, `format.json`, and `fixture.json`
restored byte-identical from `origin/pagestore`, so it still proves the new
daemon opens a store written by the previous format unchanged.
`fixtures/posix-timeline-delete-holes` is the new current-role fixture: a
full `fixture`-workload capture (`check_segment_formats()`/
`check_archived_identities()` require every advertised identity present in
some current fixture) whose deleted branch's target records are still
memtable-resident, unflushed, when the extend-phase daemon's clean stop
happens -- `ps_memtable_discard_timeline()` empties the memtable of exactly
the target's own entries during deletion cleanup, so with no other write
left in the memtable, `ps_core_close()`'s unconditional flush-if-nonempty
never fires and the captured holes sit *above* the final flush watermark,
inside the region a reopen actually rescans.  That placement is deliberate
and load-bearing for the fixture's mutation check
(`page_segment.hole_bad_len`, a corrupted hole `len` must be refused) and for
proving the base daemon's own failure mode directly: opening the archived
store with the pre-fix `pagestore_daemon` binary fails closed with
`incompatible record magic 0x53454831` at the first hole's offset, not a
silent stale-format acceptance.

An older (pre-fix) daemon opening a store containing a hole fails closed
this way only when the hole lies in the region that daemon's `recover()`
actually rescans -- above its own last flush watermark.  A hole the fixed
daemon tombstoned and then flushed past (the ordinary case) sits below the
watermark, where a downgraded daemon's `recover()` never revisits it at all
and reopens successfully, oblivious to the hole; that store is fine to keep
reading, but is not a store to run a further timeline deletion against on
the old daemon -- `timeline_delete_page_cleanup_one()`'s validate-only pass 1
never expects a `SEG_HOLE*_MAGIC` word and has no path that produces one, so
any deletion whose target shares a segment with an existing hole stalls in
DELETING, retryable but never progressing, until the store is reopened by a
daemon that understands holes.  (This is a different pass-1 stall than L6's,
below: an old daemon failing closed on a hole magic it genuinely does not
understand, inside the region it rescans, is the intended fail-closed
behavior for corruption of indexed bytes -- unlike L6, where pass 1 used to
fail closed on bytes *no* daemon, old or new, had ever indexed at all.  L6's
reachable-region fix does not touch this paragraph's scenario.)  The new daemon reads every store written
entirely before this fix unchanged (no hole magics exist in them, and a
rebased watermark from a pre-fix deletion is simply a valid,
never-retreating-further watermark to the new daemon).  The manifest's
flush-watermark rebase record (`PS_MANIFEST_REBASE_FLUSH_WATERMARK`) is no
longer written -- its parser stays, permanently, to replay a pre-fix
manifest -- so this is not a manifest format change, only the page-segment
family's.

### D6. MVP deployment boundary

Recommended: keep default-tablespace local POSIX as the MVP boundary.  Treat
user tablespaces, S3, SPDK layers, and service-manager packaging as follow-up
work.

Decision: **accepted for MVP**.  Default-tablespace local POSIX is the required
deployment boundary.  User tablespaces, S3, SPDK layers, and service-manager
packaging do not block MVP completion.

## Proposed PR sequence

The default sequence was:

1. R3b retained-base foundation, then the WAL reclaimer enabled by replacement-base compaction -- done;
2. R4b forkmeta compaction/reclamation and publication crash tests -- done;
3. R5 timeline deletion -- done;
4. R5b reclaimer backpressure controllers -- done;
5. H0 fault/inspection primitives -- done;
6. H1 composed crash scenarios -- done;
7. H2 format fixtures and compatibility CI -- done;
8. R6 bounded-space acceptance and final MVP status update -- soak and
   nightly lane done; the seed-20260909 `wal`-bound flake is explained and
   fixed (#265); the reader-snapshot FSM reopen blocker the fix's PRs hit is
   fixed (#264), with its F3 root cause (a pruned ordered marker rescanned
   after a timeline-delete rewrite) tracked as an open, explicitly
   release-blocking follow-up in `RELEASE_VALIDATION.md` -- not an MVP gate,
   since #264's F2 mitigation already turns it into a logged pruning
   reversal rather than silent loss, and gate 5's format fixtures stay
   complete; the artifact-key collision that made #264/#265/#266 all fail
   the integration lane identically is fixed (#266); the final status update
   follows a green scheduled-nightly run history against the post-fix
   revision.

What remains: the three-seed scheduled nightly lane accumulating a green run
history against `316401d8d4b` and later (the fixes above), then the final
MVP status update.  A manually dispatched run against that revision,
[35458043758](https://github.com/clapdb/postgres/actions/runs/35458043758)
(seed 20260909, 8000 rounds, 2026-09-19), confirms the fix on one dispatched
run -- 45024 checks, 0 failures, `physical_max.wal` 1736704 bytes against the
4667392 bound, `wal_fence_slack_max` 1568768 bytes -- but it is not yet the
scheduled-run history this gate asks for.

Keep each PR independently reviewable and keep the existing standalone and
golden suites green.  If work packages depend on one another before their base
lands, use stacked PRs and finish with an explicit roll-up PR to `pagestore`.

| 2026-09-06 | Added the minimal H1 relation inspection slice: protocol 45/schema 4, a dedicated private request/response mailbox with daemon-instance, generation, timeout, and concurrent-client fencing, strict relation-only read validation, coherent all-shard as-of existence/fork nblocks, explicit unavailable selected version, and expected timeline-incarnation fencing | POSIX standalone plus Python schema/runtime coverage; no SPDK execution |
| 2026-09-06 | Hardened H1 relation inspection follow-up: protocol 45, POSIX fd ownership lock across the complete inspector transaction, direct release-published REQUEST without CLAIMED, bounded abandoned-slot recovery, and strict main-fork/existence consistency validation | Focused POSIX mailbox coverage plus standalone/Python tests; no SPDK execution |
| 2026-09-06 | Closed H1 relation-mailbox ownership gaps: byte-zero initialization/client gate, byte-one daemon lifetime lease acquired after byte zero and retained on the shm fd through shutdown, lease-gated stale REQUEST/BUSY recovery, and real fork/SIGKILL lock coverage; published the POSIX-only mailbox capability so standalone assertions are skipped for unsupported frontends | POSIX mailbox, standalone, and Python tests; no SPDK execution |
| 2026-09-10 | Sealed forkmeta source and snapshot payload records as FKM3 (FKM2 layout, CRC-24 in the former pad bytes; a complete record with a bad checksum refuses to open instead of being treated as a torn tail); FKM2 stays readable; `fixtures/posix-mvp-baseline` becomes the legacy fixture and `fixtures/posix-forkmeta-crc` the current one; the fixture check distinguishes legacy (reopen/oracle) from current (identity pin plus mutations) fixtures and takes several directories | First format change through the fixture process; cutover, crash-matrix, timeline, lifecycle unit tests; both fixtures checked; standalone and integration lanes |
| 2026-09-10 | Added the first H2 persisted-format fixture slice: per-module format identities and `pagestore_format_versions`, a `fixture` workload covering every daemon-side POSIX family, `harness/pagestore_fixture.py` capture/check with identity freshness, reopen-and-restart oracle, and thirty-six mutation cases, `fixtures/posix-mvp-baseline`, meson and standalone CI checks; fixed relocated-store layer locations and a damaged forkmeta marker discarding post-cutover events; documented the forkmeta record checksum gap | Fixture check locally against the captured baseline; layer-store and forkmeta crash-matrix unit tests; standalone and integration lanes; D5 remains open and is flagged as an assumption |
| 2026-09-10 | Added the H1 fork-metadata publication crash slice: a `forkmeta` gc_seed workload (page-pruning cutoff, thirty-two relations with create/zero-extend/truncate events on both sides of the cutoff, post-cutoff trickle for the second generation) composing the four existing `forkmeta.*` probes, with staged/selected/marker/GC snapshots, settled-generation recovery, current and retained fork sizes, refused below-cutoff queries, and idempotent restart | Harness validation tests; four meson/CI scenarios against the POSIX daemon; no SPDK execution |
| 2026-09-10 | Added the H1 restart-combination slice: a `restart` operation for the writer runtime (writer, installed pinned readers via boot-control restore) and the materializer runtime (writer, supervisor-replaced worker, store with all computes down), plus `writer_reader_restart` and `materializer_restart_combinations` scenarios asserting reader horizon and prepared-xid hiding across restarts and materialized boundaries after writer, worker, and store restarts | Harness validation tests and meson plan checks; both scenarios in the integration CI lane; no SPDK execution |
| 2026-09-10 | Added the H1 manifest replacement crash slice: map-held probes after the fsync'd compacted temp log and after its rename, crashed temp-log removal on manifest open, a `manifest_compact` gc_seed workload (320 pages under a harness-held maintenance pause, workload-armed fault and release), per-stage temp-file snapshots, reconciled-manifest recovery with every page served and no temp log, and idempotent restart | Harness validation tests; two meson/CI scenarios against the POSIX daemon; manifest unit test; no SPDK execution |
| 2026-09-10 | Added the H1 timeline deletion crash slice: lock-held probes after the durable DELETING event, after private WAL/WAL-index removal, after a shared segment rewrite, and after the durable DELETED event; a `timeline_delete` gc_seed workload (branch with private WAL, WAL-index interval, owner layer, shared-segment pages, workload-armed BEGIN_DELETE); per-stage private-artifact snapshots, DELETED-with-token recovery, parent readable, branch reads rejected, owner artifacts gone, manifest reconciled, no owner, and idempotent restart | Harness validation tests; four meson/CI scenarios against the POSIX daemon; no SPDK execution |
| 2026-09-10 | Added the H1 WAL reclaim crash slice: named store-lock probes before the first unlink, after each unlink, and before the residual-prefix directory fsync; a `wal_reclaim` gc_seed workload (three sealed segments, control note at the shipped end, workload-armed fault, WAL-index progress); per-stage sealed-segment snapshot counts, unlink-retry recovery, refused prefix reads, WAL end/retain floor, cleared reclaim debt, no owner, and idempotent restart | Harness validation tests; three meson/CI scenarios against the POSIX daemon; fault registry and WAL-store unit tests; no SPDK execution |
| 2026-09-10 | Added the H1 WAL-index compaction crash slice: a `wal_index` gc_seed workload (fixed WAL-index reader at 40 under three FPI-led chains, one committed interval, workload-armed fault), a `--walidx-snapshot-bytes` daemon trigger override, and a process abort after the durable WAL-index frontier with staged-generation snapshot, retried commit, chain/refusal reads, owner, and idempotent-restart checks | Harness validation tests; meson/CI scenario against the POSIX daemon; no SPDK execution |
| 2026-09-10 | Added the H1 page-pruning crash slice: a `gc_seed` daemon-harness operation backed by `pagestore_gc_crash_client` (three history generations, newer block, workload-armed fault, configured cutoff at 3500), three process aborts after the durable prune frontier, the compacted layer's manifest publication, and the retired layer's mark-delete, with snapshot, recovery-read, manifest reconciliation, retained-horizon, and idempotent-restart checks | Harness validation tests; three meson/CI scenarios against the POSIX daemon; no SPDK execution |
| 2026-09-10 | Made the materializer's WAL-index horizon page-protected by its own derived cutoff (unless another WAL-index-only owner shares the LSN), so stored pages replace its FPI-led chains and the soak's WAL bound returns to two publication intervals | Reclaim-core case (a WAL/WAL-index materializer pin authorizes the base at its horizon; a shared LSN still does not); control/lifecycle/standalone suites; integration lane; 2400/8000-round soaks within the tighter bound |
| 2026-09-10 | Added SLRU-class and reader-artifact retention: seeds (replay bases), reader snapshots, the live SLRU mirror, tombstones, and the watermark follow the relation plan below their consumers' pins and branch fork points, and a retired artifact releases its control-image fence (the registry now counts artifact versions) | Control-prune cases for a pinned reader, a branch fork point, a dropped pin, retry collapse, fence release, and restart; lifecycle/reclaim/standalone suites; integration lane; 2400/8000-round soaks |
| 2026-09-10 | Added the nightly long-run soak workflow: a seed matrix (default three seeds at 8000 rounds) built from the freestanding daemon and harness, scheduled daily and dispatchable with chosen seeds/rounds, with per-job report summaries and 30-day JSON artifacts | Workflow YAML validated; the same soak binary and report format as the pull-request lane |
| 2026-09-10 | Derived the operational page-history cutoff from the writing compute (the materializer's restart-redo pin, or the newest checkpoint note's redo), kept the exact-redo twin of every retained checkpoint image, gave the branch controller's base pin page history, and modeled the real materializer mask plus progress marker in the soak | Control-prune cases for marker and note cutoffs with refusal below the frontier and restart; lifecycle/reclaim/standalone suites; integration lane with pruning active in the golden and branch-boot flows; 2400/8000-round soaks |
| 2026-09-11 | Rolled the merged #238-#248 stack (SLRU/reader retention, materializer horizon, the H1 page-prune/WAL-index/WAL-reclaim/timeline-delete/manifest/restart/forkmeta slices, the first H2 fixture slice, FKM3) onto `pagestore`; the stacked PRs had each merged into the PR below them, so their content had stopped on the top branch | PR #249, ancestry-only merge with the tree of the reviewed #248 head; pagestore CI green |
| 2026-09-11 | Scheduled the nightly soak: GitHub runs schedules only from the default branch and `master` is reserved for the upstream mirror, so `pagestore` became the repository's default branch and the workflow gained a schedule guard (this repository or `PAGESTORE_NIGHTLY_ENABLED=1`; manual dispatch always); the interim copy on `master` (#250) is withdrawn | A 200-round dispatch resolved and checked out `pagestore` at the #249 merge, 1426 checks, 0 failures; after the default-branch change a 100-round dispatch ran from `pagestore` itself (run 34610482840, 978 checks, 0 failures) |
| 2026-09-12 | Decided D5: PostgreSQL-native payloads are wrapped and never rewritten, with their PostgreSQL version identity recorded in the envelope and checked by the loader; daemon envelopes keep a fixture per shipped version with explicit migration or fail-closed; container formats are registered per provider (SPDK `spdk_super` and extent layout included, its fixture after the MVP); backend artifacts follow the same envelope/payload split | `MVP_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` D5; the H2 backend slices are sequenced against these rules |
| 2026-09-12 | Registered the POSIX and SPDK container identities and made the SPDK superblock fail closed and durable: `pagestore_spdk_super.c` (no SPDK dependency) decodes the checksummed v2 and both legacy struct images, refuses truncated, overlong, foreign, newer, corrupt, differently sized or differently sharded superblocks instead of zeroing the segment counts, publishes v2 through NVMe flush, temp/fsync/rename/dir-fsync with failures returned to `spdk_sync()`; `posix_container` and `spdk_container` join `pagestore_format_versions` and the current fixture's identity table | `pagestore_spdk_super_test` (69 checks) in meson and the standalone lane; the fixture check passes against both fixtures; the SPDK daemon links with the module |
| 2026-09-12 | Bound the PostgreSQL payload identity on the paths that hand bytes to PostgreSQL: shipped-WAL envelope version 2 records `xlp_magic`, `xlp_info` and the WAL segment size from the payload's page header (read in host byte order, as PostgreSQL wrote it) in the bytes version 1 reserved, the store re-derives them from the first chunk once per open before serving any range, `pagestore_walrestore` (now built with the PostgreSQL headers) refuses a WAL page magic or segment size the payload was not written for, and a read the store refuses, with an exit status recovery treats as fatal, `pagestore_control_restore --payload-identity` prints the build's tuple and the control install refuses an image whose WAL segment size differs from the target cluster's; `posix-wal-payload-identity` is the current fixture, its predecessor legacy | `pagestore_wal_segment_test` (25 checks), fixture check across three fixtures with the new use-rejected mutation, meson fixture check against the build's identity, integration test with accept/refuse assertions for the restore command, golden scenario and managed materializer smoke with bound restore commands |
| 2026-09-12 | Bound the SLRU seed pages' PostgreSQL identity on every seeding path (`pagestore_seed_branch_slrus_impl` resolves the control image at the base cutoff, refuses a cutoff with none, and checks its compatibility tuple; the controller's horizon derivation checks it too) and proved the seeders' replay against recovery: `pagestore.seed_reference_slru_dir` compares every reconstructed page with the paused materializer's before writing it, the branch controller sets it with `--verify-seed-against-materializer`, and the golden scenario requires pages of all four SLRUs to have been compared equal | Golden scenario (4 reconstructed pages equal), integration test (fail-closed base cutoff, forged-reference mismatch and missing-segment refusals, nothing published), branch boot test |
| 2026-09-13 | Closed the R4b concurrency clause: the crash matrix's deterministic concurrent appender runs at every publication boundary (prepare, manifest commit, source rewrite, snapshot GC) creating and growing a relation of its own with the acks published before its admission-rd is released, and recovery must show the acknowledged size and carry each acknowledged event's record exactly once across the selected snapshot parts and the source suffix; the composed `forkmeta` workload records every trickle create and growth in a ledger (`--ack-file`) as pending and then acknowledged, the first eight relations acknowledged before maintenance may run, its verify oracle holds recovery, and the additional restart, to each acknowledged step exactly once while allowing an in-flight step either outcome, and the harness counts each acknowledged event's record in the durable set, requiring one | `pagestore_forkmeta_crash_matrix_test` (273 checks, repeated runs), the four composed forkmeta scenarios (58--66 acknowledged appends verified each, twice, one in flight; every acknowledged record counted once), harness unit tests, standalone suite |
| 2026-09-19 | Explained and closed the nightly `wal`-bound flake (seed 20260909, runs 34747373574/34825221247): the WAL reclaimer's raw WAL-index dependency floor only moved at a WAL-index controller-forced publication, and its one-second no-progress backoff was not cancelled when a proof input changed; `wal_segment_reclaim_one` now requests an on-demand compacted WAL-index publication for a segment blocked only by the stale raw floor, and the backoff is cancelled by a proof-epoch bump on retention/WAL-index-publish/GC/progress/timeline-delete events; the soak's `wal` during-bound is restated from five declared terms (4667392, 18 KiB tighter) with a per-sample check tying physical WAL to the soak's own fences (`wal_fence_slack_max` in the report) | Three new `pagestore_wal_reclaim_core_test` cases (fail on 59fc63bc4d2, pass with the fix; 128 checks, 0 failures total); reclaim core, walidx snapshot/prune, control/lifecycle prune, artifact lifecycle, gc, and standalone suites green; seed 20260909 at 8000 rounds 5/5 plain and 3/3 contended runs, seeds 7/4242 at 8000 rounds, and the 2400-round PR-lane size, all with `physical_max.wal` well under the new bound and the fence check reporting 0 failures |
| 2026-09-19 | Independent review of the `wal`-bound fix found and closed three gaps before merge: (1) a lost-wakeup ordering bug -- the no-progress backoff must record the proof epoch as read before this attempt's own proof inputs, not a fresh read at arm time, because a retention pin drop (dispatched without the admission lock) landing in the window this attempt has released walidx_prune_lock/wal_lock for the retention-floor scan could otherwise bump the epoch before the backoff recorded it and the wakeup would be lost; (2) the epoch-cancelled retry needed a rate limit (WAL_RECLAIM_REARM_MIN_NS, 20 ms) since every re-evaluation is a full drain and PIN_DROP does not itself drain admission; (3) the reclaim-due request must be fence-keyed (re-issued only when the raw floor or a retention-registry fence changed since the last served request, tracked via a dedicated `walidx_reclaim_fence_epoch`, not `retention_effective_floor`'s own numeric value, which a newly reserved pin need not move) rather than progress-keyed, since the backend materializer publishes durable WAL-index progress once per indexing batch and a progress advance alone can never retire the blocking item; also reset the three new per-timeline request-tracking arrays (and the pre-existing force_due/gc_force_due/reclaim_due flags, a latent in-process-reopen leak) in `ps_core_open_impl` | Extended `test_no_progress_backoff_follows_proof` and `test_unreplaceable_dependency_requests_once` (both fail on the pre-review branch head: the former needs `sleep` past the rate-limit floor, the latter sees the snapshot generation grow past 2 on progress-only advances); new `test_epoch_retries_are_rate_limited` and `test_backoff_epoch_predates_attempt_inputs` reclaim-core cases; `maintenance_until_count`'s iteration budget raised (2048) to accommodate the rate-limit floor under real per-pass I/O cost; 169 reclaim-core checks, 0 failures; full standalone suite green; seed 20260909 at 8000 rounds 5/5 plain and 3/3 contended, `physical_max.wal` ~1.7-1.8 MiB (unchanged order of magnitude) |
| 2026-09-19 | Round-2 review of the `wal`-bound fix found and closed two more gaps before merge: (1) the three PS_OP_RETENTION_PIN_SET/RESERVE/DROP sites only bumped the reclaimer's proof/fence epochs when the changed resources included PAGE_HISTORY or WAL, but `walidx_prune_fences` fences the compaction plan on WAL_INDEX pins too, so a WAL_INDEX-only pin drop/move left the reclaimer fruitless-suppressed until the WAL-index controller's own trigger noticed independently -- fixed by also bumping on `(old|new) & PS_RETENTION_RESOURCE_WAL_INDEX`; (2) the retained `walidx_snapshot_end[tl] < progress` guard on the reclaim-due request was removed: "a publication already covering current progress cannot drop more" is false for fence changes, since removing a fence lets the plan drop more raw items at the very same end_lsn a prior publication already reached (the publish path's own write-section guard already admits `end_lsn == previous_end` when `reclaim_due` is set).  Also hardened two flaky test assertions (measure elapsed since the arm instead of assuming two fsyncs cost nothing; assert the final drain count advances by exactly one instead of landing on an absolute value) and rewrote `maintenance_until_count` to bound on wall-clock time (1 s) instead of a fixed iteration count, since a store with other work pending can report "did work" on every pass without ever idling, making a fixed budget's real cost scenario-dependent | New `test_walidx_only_pin_drop_requests_compaction` (fails without the epoch-bump fix and the guard removal: the store stays stuck after dropping the WAL_INDEX-only pin); 176 reclaim-core checks, 0 failures, stable across repeated runs; full standalone suite green; seed 20260909 at 8000 rounds |
| 2026-09-19 | Fixed the PR #262 review finding (`RELEASE_VALIDATION.md`): a live ordered write's in-memory fork history recorded a plain GROW instead of the bound marker recovery would rebuild, so a second forkmeta cutover in one daemon lifetime published a plain GROW and the store could not reopen. `append_page_impl()`'s live path now inserts the marker-plus-activation recovery itself rebuilds; `replay_page_record()` gained a fail-closed `fork_event_adopt_orphaned_seg()` fallback that heals a store already in the broken state by matching a plain GROW's exact nonzero admission identity, logging each adoption; `recover_layer_prefix()`/`recover()` log the refused/retired record's full tuple instead of a bare stale-errno message. No persisted format changed | `pagestore_forkmeta_cutover_test` new cases `test_live_ordered_marker_survives_two_cutovers`, `test_live_ordered_commit_marker_survives_two_cutovers`, `test_live_ordered_marker_walless_survives_two_cutovers`, `test_orphaned_ordered_marker_adopted`, `test_orphaned_ordered_marker_not_adopted_on_mismatch` (331 checks total, each new case failing before the fix and passing after); `pagestore_forkmeta_crash_matrix_test` (273 checks) and `pagestore_test` (2074 checks) unaffected; `integration_test.sh` gained a clean-shutdown reopen of its own retained store (`ok - retained store reopens independently after clean shutdown`, `ok - no orphaned ordered records were adopted on reopen`; FAILs on the reverted core); format fixtures (`posix-mvp-baseline`, `posix-forkmeta-crc`, `posix-artifact-lifecycle`) and `pagestore_format_versions` unchanged; the real daemon opening the preserved failing integration store logs 625 adoptions and reaches `ready` |
| 2026-09-19 | Revision 2 on independent review of the fix above (findings F2/F3/F5): generalized the adoption rule to a stated proof, `fork_meta_orphan_proven()` (the selected forkmeta snapshot's freeze sequence covers the record's admission sequence -- provably true only for a durably-appended-then-lost marker, never a torn append, because the admission write lock that computes freeze_seq drains every append holding the admission read lock across `append_page_impl()`), applied to both the existing growth-class rule and a new commit-class rule (`fork_event_adopt_orphaned_commit_seg()`, an inert `FEV_SEG_COMMIT_BOUND` proven safe by the fork's size rather than by identity, since a commit-class rewrite never left a plain GROW to match) on both the layer and segment-suffix recovery paths -- F2 closed a real gap: the FSM/VM commit-rewrite pattern could not self-heal before this.  Identified and recorded as open (not fixed here, kept reviewable): F3, a pre-existing defect where `fork_meta_snapshot_build()` degrades/drops a marker whose page version was pruned from memory, and a timeline-delete rewrite rebasing the flush watermark to 0 makes the next open rescan and meet that orphan; this PR mitigates its commit-class outcome (a silently retired segment tail) into a logged pruning reversal via F2, adds regression assertions that fail on the baseline core, and records the mechanism, invariant (I3), and follow-up design in `RELEASE_VALIDATION.md`.  Reworded every "self-heals" / "never needs the adoption rule" overclaim across the code comments, test comments, and docs to the precise statement (proof + growth-or-size match).  F5 (linear event scans over inert commit markers, O(N) per record for FSM/VM forks) noted as a tracked follow-up, no code change | `pagestore_forkmeta_cutover_test` new cases `test_orphaned_commit_marker_adopted`, `test_orphaned_commit_marker_segment_path`, `test_orphaned_commit_marker_not_proven`, `test_orphaned_commit_marker_size_mismatch`, `test_deletion_filtered_forkmeta_commit_shape`, plus `test_orphaned_ordered_marker_adopted` migrated off a no-snapshot construction onto the real forkmeta snapshot publication API (459 checks total; the four new positive assertions fail with the freeze-proof/commit-rule change reverted and pass with it; the two F3 regression assertions fail on the unmodified baseline and pass on the branch); `pagestore_forkmeta_crash_matrix_test` (273 checks) and `pagestore_test` (2074 checks) unaffected; `integration_test.sh`'s reopen guard gained two more assertions (`ok - no segment tail was retired on reopen`, `ok - no ordered record was refused on reopen`) and reworded the adoption-count assertion as the F3 detector (this run: 0/0/0); format fixtures and `pagestore_format_versions` unchanged; admission-read-lock-across-append_page_impl citation: `pagestore_daemon.c` `run_request()` (`ps_admission_read_lock()` at the write-op branch, held across `run_request_admitted()`, released only after it returns) |
| 2026-09-19 | Revision 3 (R2-F1) on further independent review: the freeze proof (`fork_meta_orphan_proven()`) is NOT a torn-append exclusion by itself, correcting Revision 2's row above -- a refused record's admission_seq is still observed to prevent identity reuse, so a later cutover can freeze past a torn record's own sequence too, making the predicate alone say "proven" on any rescan after that cutover, not only the first one after a crash (reviewer evidence: `review-fsm/torn_test.c`, `./torn_test 8`, lifetime 3 adopted a never-acknowledged torn commit-class body and served the wrong tag).  Kept the freeze predicate as a necessary filter only and added the real, path-specific torn-exclusion proof for the commit-class rule: unchanged (residency) on the image-layer path; on the segment-suffix path (`recover()`), added a one-slot look-ahead -- a refused, otherwise-adoptable commit-class record is stashed instead of retired immediately, and resolved (inert marker inserted, logged with the complete record's offset) only when the next record in the same segment parses completely, or retired (now saying `no complete record follows in this segment`) if the scan ends first -- because a torn body is structurally always the last complete record of its segment (`append_page_impl()` advances the shard cursor only after the marker append succeeded).  Deliberately kept `admission_seq_observe()`/`segment_order_id_observe()` on every replayed record including refused ones (removing them to make the freeze proof sound would let a post-crash retry collide with the torn record's own identity).  The growth-class rule needed no change (sound unconditionally on both paths, proven separately).  Reworded the three "torn append's sequence is always above every freeze sequence" claims (`pagestore_core.c`, `RELEASE_VALIDATION.md`, the cutover test's header comment) to state the necessary-only status precisely.  Also initialized an unrelated pre-existing uninitialized-read (`byte` in a corruption-fixture helper, `pagestore_forkmeta_cutover_test.c`) flagged by static analysis while this code was already being touched | `pagestore_forkmeta_cutover_test` new cases `test_torn_commit_append_never_adopted` (fails on the Revision-2 core: lifetime 3 adopts and serves the torn tag; passes with the look-ahead), `test_torn_growth_append_never_adopted`, `test_orphaned_commit_marker_segment_path_last_is_retired`; `test_orphaned_commit_marker_segment_path` reworked onto a fork+`_exit()` harness (a clean `close_runtime()` unconditionally flushes every memtable into a layer, so the prior close-based construction never actually exercised the segment-suffix path at all) with a following complete record, now asserting the `... followed by a complete record at offset N` line (490 checks total); reviewer's `./torn_test 8` (rebuilt against the new objects) retires again in lifetime 3 and serves the committed tag; `review-fsm/dbg_test2.c` commit-shape scenario still adopts and serves LSN 200; `review-fsm/store-commit` still reopens with two adoptions (layer path, unaffected); `store-failing` still reopens with 625 adoptions, 0 commit adoptions (all growth-class); `pagestore_forkmeta_crash_matrix_test` (273 checks) and `pagestore_test` (2074 checks) unaffected; fixture check (54 checks) and `pagestore_format_versions` unchanged; `integration_test.sh` (278 ok, all four guard counts 0); standalone-lane `cc -O2 -Wall -Wextra -Werror` compiles of `pagestore_forkmeta_cutover_test`, `pagestore_daemon`, and `pagestore_forkmeta_crash_matrix_test` against the new core are clean |
| 2026-09-12 | Gave the controller's and supervisor's JSON artifacts their identities and fixture: `pagestore_artifact_schema.py` holds each kind's schema, accepted/refused schemas, checksum rule and key set, both tools stamp and judge through it (the retention authorities and the supervisor status gain a schema member and `crc32`, their previous layouts read as legacy), and `fixtures/controller-json`, captured from the golden scenario and the managed materializer smoke, is checked by `harness/pagestore_controller_fixture.py` in the standalone lane | controller fixture check (6 artifacts load, 40 mutations refused or accepted as declared), both tools' unit suites, golden scenario and managed materializer smoke with the capture hooks |
| 2026-09-12 | Gave the backend's data-directory artifacts their identities and fixture: `pagestore_artifact_format.h` names and lays out the prepared branch's manifest and bootstrap, the prepared reader's manifest, snapshot and catalog provenance, the reader-map intent marker and the SLRU mirror's primed marker (both now value at 0 with an identity trailer at 8, legacy read, foreign fails closed), the backend's structs are pinned to them, `pagestore_format_versions` reports the `pgdata` family, `pagestore_pgdata_artifact_check()` loads an artifact through its production loader, `integration_test.sh` captures a real backend's artifacts, and `fixtures/pgdata-artifacts` is checked by `harness/pagestore_pgdata_fixture.py` -- identities in the standalone lane, loaders and twenty-one mutations in a scratch cluster in the integration lane | pgdata fixture check (8 artifacts load, 21 mutations rejected or accepted as declared), store fixture check across four fixtures, standalone suite, integration test (with the capture hook), golden scenario, branch boot test |
| 2026-09-12 | Gave the backend's store-object payloads their identities: `pagestore_artifact_format.h` (freestanding) holds the layouts of the redo note, SLRU watermark and tombstone (value at 0, identity trailer at 8, zero for legacy), the materializer marker and release and writer checkpoint blocks, and the five reader snapshot objects, plus PostgreSQL's CRC-32C; the backend stamps and checks the trailers, the daemon's WAL floor fails closed on a note it cannot read, `pagestore_format_versions` reports all twelve identities, the fixture workload seeds one of each and verifies them on reopen, `posix-backend-objects` is the current fixture and `posix-wal-payload-identity` legacy | `pagestore_control_prune_test` (legacy note counts, foreign trailer makes the floor unknown), fixture check across four fixtures, standalone suite, integration test, golden scenario, materializer smoke; `--payload-identity` proves the header's CRC-32C against `pg_crc32c` |
| 2026-09-09 | Added the R6 bounded-space soak (`pagestore_soak_test`, standalone CI) and closed four retention gaps it exposed: control-object version pruning fenced by retained WAL boundaries, WAL-index replacement bases from durable stored page versions and fork deaths, forkmeta cutoff exemption for frontier-less branch timelines, and bounded fork-lifecycle history (invalidated versions dropped by image compaction, base/fence/growth planner with required invalidation fences, compacting deletion-forced generations) | 2400/6000/8000-round runs (three seeds): every category within bound, WAL reclaimed to the last immutable segment, forkmeta at 5-22 KB; lifecycle (178), control-prune (32), WAL-index planner (27), forkmeta planner (12040), reclaim core (95), timeline (316), backpressure (369), forkmeta cutover/crash (259/245), gc (93), standalone (2074), and backpressure daemon (79) suites green |
| 2026-09-06 | Added the first composed H1 materializer crash slice: pause-only checkpointer-child probes after relation sync/before marker write and after marker sync/before retention advance, whole-postmaster recovery, exact fault reports, marker monotonicity, R1/R2 timeline-0 incarnation-1 relation inspection with main-fork growth, and recovered SQL visibility | Python validation/runtime mocks, focused plan validation, explicit PostgreSQL CI lane; real integration lane is CI-owned; no SPDK execution |
| 2026-08-28 | Added the first R3b retained-base foundation: checksummed identity v2, validated v1 migration, strict base/end reopen validation, monotonic atomic retained-base publication, explicit getter status, append publication-fault recovery, and fail-closed ambiguous directory-fsync handling; immutable segments and retention policy are unchanged | Focused WAL-store coverage for getter validation, reopen, monotonic advance/rollback rejection, metadata corruption, append/advance publication faults, crash recovery, prefix unlink/reopen, unexpected suffix validation, recognized temporary cleanup, and 83 checks with 0 failures |
| 2026-08-28 | Added R3b-2 standalone crash-safe physical immutable-prefix reclamation: `ps_wal_store_reclaim_prefix()` publishes retained/physical frontiers before unlink, uses the WAL mutex as a reader drain/barrier, fully validates/sorts residual candidates before ascending unlink, revalidates every main-catalog candidate immediately before unlink, keeps partial unlink catalog state exact, fences ambiguous directory fsync, and retries residual prefixes after restart; no core maintenance or cutoff policy | Final focused WAL-store test: 167 checks, 0 failures; includes reverse-enumeration candidate ordering, scan-error zero-unlink, low/middle main-catalog corruption and residual corruption, lowest/middle unlink failures, per-candidate header/CRC validation, real fork/`_exit` stops before unlink/after partial unlink/before directory fsync, pending-reclaim advance fencing, deterministic reader-barrier timing, idempotence, boundary rejection, and restart retry |
| 2026-08-28 | Added conservative R3b-3 POSIX/core WAL reclaim policy integration: cheap WAL-lock-only due preselection plus bounded no-progress backoff, durable retained-base admission with per-level WAL-lock read rechecks and inherited-parent fallback, fair one-LIVE-timeline scheduling ahead of continuous tier/remote-GC work, admission drain plus WAL-index freeze and single-timeline WAL locking, target branch/control caps, dependency/retention/progress minimum cutoff (including progress beyond the sealed prefix), residual-prefix retry at an already-published frontier, DELETED-descendant release, fail-closed pending-proof/publication handling, and one-second retry backoff; physical directory start is not a runtime fence and pre-metadata timelines retain local WAL reads | Focused core policy test: 66 checks, 0 failures; covers empty and boundary-floor preselection, ancestry and natural nonzero child fallback, child-local controls and target branch caps, LIVE/DELETING/DELETED structural floors and WAL-index exceptions, timeline isolation, naturally nonzero starts, unaligned and boundary-crossing flat progress tails, snapshot recovery plus WAL/WAL-index re-ship admission after base advancement, pre-metadata reads, restart/residual retry, fenced residual-query suppression, read/frontier publication and floor-scan lock-order races, no-proof candidate fairness, pending durable-proof cleanup failure, metadata publication failure/backoff, and admission concurrency; sparse/discrete base crossing and bounded fixed-reader soak remain out of scope |
| 2026-08-15 | Added the pure R4 replacement-base planner: operational and discrete horizons retain a union of FPI-led redo chains, future records remain intact, and legacy/insufficient metadata fails closed | Dedicated planner unit tests; durable frontier and snapshot cutover remain the next stacked change |
| 2026-08-15 | Split WAL-index snapshot publication into durable shard preparation and atomic manifest commit | Creates the crash-safe insertion point for the R4 reclaimed frontier without changing the existing one-shot API |
| 2026-08-15 | Completed R4 WAL-index entry compaction and durable frontier admission | Multi-shard proof, discrete/operational chain integration, restart/corruption coverage, and a deterministic crash after frontier publication |
| 2026-09-19 | Fixed a silent artifact-key collision between the automatic checkpoint-driven reader snapshot and an explicit exact-R publish (PRs #264/#265/#266 all failed the integration lane identically at "daemon reported error for op 34"): the explicit publish now uses an owner-scoped `dbOid` key for its DATA object instead of sharing the automatic snapshot's `InvalidOid` key, publishes its manifest under a new dedicated `PS_READER_SNAPSHOT_OWNER_MANIFEST_OBJECT` rather than aliasing the automatic per-database manifest's real-database-OID namespace at `MANIFEST_OBJECT`, and no longer publishes the automatic-only "global" manifest fallback; `ps_artifact_begin`/`commit`/`drop` report a refusal reason (`PsArtifactRefuseReason`, append-only) that the daemon logs and the client echoes instead of a bare op number, closing the diagnostic gap that made the original failures a one-line mystery for three PRs in a row (D5 note above; RELEASE_VALIDATION.md's "Integration-lane finding") | `pagestore_artifact_lifecycle_test.c`'s `test_reader_snapshot_owner_key_split` covers the refusal-reason plumbing and the per-`dbOid` producer independence the fix relies on (it cannot reach the base bug itself, which was `pagestore.c`'s key choice, not the lifecycle); `integration_test.sh`'s reader section is the actual regression test -- it forces the collision order deterministically (polls the automatic generation into existence before the explicit publish) instead of racing worker timing, fails with the key reverted ("artifact begin: newer generation exists"), and asserts no refusal line at the end of a passing run; full `meson test --suite pagestore` (74/74), all three fixture checks (store, pgdata, controller) unchanged with `--require-build-match`, `KEEPTMP=1 integration_test.sh`, `mvp_golden_test.sh`, and `branch_boot_test.sh` all green |
| 2026-09-20 | Follow-up review of the above artifact-key fix found and fixed a second, latent collision before it shipped: the explicit publish's manifest had reused MANIFEST_OBJECT's `dbOid` slot, which is the automatic per-database manifest's real-database-OID namespace (tracked/retired by the reader database barrier) -- an owner id equal to a live database's OID would have aliased that database's manifest and risked the barrier dropping it. Gave the explicit manifest its own object number instead (see D5 note); corrected two doc inaccuracies (the unit test does not reach the base bug; the owner id is range-checked, not truncated); mapped the "refused before ps_artifact_begin ran at all" case (`PS_ARTIFACT_REFUSE_NONE`, the daemon's klass/timeline gates) to an explicit message instead of a bare "none"; recorded the R4-2 poisoning and forkmeta-cutoff-vs-fenced-artifact follow-ups as open in RELEASE_VALIDATION.md | Full `meson test --suite pagestore` (74/74), all three fixture checks unchanged with `--require-build-match`, the unit test in both SLRU/reader-snapshot klass modes, `KEEPTMP=1 integration_test.sh`, `mvp_golden_test.sh`, and `branch_boot_test.sh` all green |
| 2026-09-20 | Filled in the first post-fix nightly soak dispatch: after #265 (the `wal`-bound flake fix) merged to `pagestore`, manually dispatched the `pagestore nightly soak` workflow at `316401d8d4b` (the #264 merge commit); recorded its numbers in `RELEASE_VALIDATION.md` and `MVP_STATUS.md` in place of the `<PAGESTORE_NIGHTLY_POSTFIX_RUN_ID>` placeholder, and updated this plan's item 8/"What remains" and `MVP_STATUS.md`'s "Recommended sequence" to reflect that the flake (#265), the FSM reopen blocker (#264), and the artifact-key collision (#266) are all fixed, while F3's root cause stays an open, explicitly release-blocking (not MVP-gating) follow-up per `RELEASE_VALIDATION.md` | Run [35458043758](https://github.com/clapdb/postgres/actions/runs/35458043758): seed 20260909, 8000 rounds, 45024 checks, 0 failures, both during-run and quiescent bounds satisfied, `physical_max.wal` 1736704 bytes against the 4667392 bound, `wal_fence_slack_max` 1568768 bytes; one dispatched run, not yet the three-seed scheduled-run history the gate asks for |
| 2026-09-20 | Resolved F5 (design A, PR 1 of 2; see RELEASE_VALIDATION.md's "Resolved: linear event scans over inert commit markers (F5)"): added a `(lsn, admission_seq)` position index over the fork-event array both insertion routines already kept in that order (`fork_event_lower_bound`/`upper_bound`/`identity_range`, bisected `fork_event_insert_pos`), gated by a per-fork `nlegacy_seq` counter so a fork holding a legacy sequence-zero event keeps the exact old linear code as its fallback; routed `fork_asof_hop`, `fork_inheritance_fenced`, `fork_event_activate_seg`, `fork_event_adopt_orphaned_seg`, `fork_event_commit_adoptable`, and `fork_meta_snapshot_marker_present` through it, and reordered `fork_meta_snapshot_append_source_markers`'s `&&` chain so the index-backed presence check runs before the version-chain walk. Added a randomized self-test (`ps_test_fork_event_index_selftest`) cross-checking every fast path against the original linear algorithms -- including, after review, that `fork_event_insert_pos()`'s slot matches a read-only reference walk for every insert, not only in aggregate -- and a deterministic step-counter scaling guard (`ps_test_fork_event_scan_steps`/`ps_test_fork_event_count`) proving sublinearity without a wall clock. Review also found the scaling case disk-bound (`flush_pages = 1` flushed one image layer per rewrite -- fine on tmpfs, ~100-300s on the standalone lane's real disk) and fixed it: K dropped 20,000 -> 5,000, the store reopens with `flush_pages` raised above K before the rewrite loop (captured at `ps_core_open()`, so a reopen is required to change it), and the wall-clock ceiling is now a logged warning, not an assertion (the step counter is the actual guard). No persisted-format change; PR 2 (design B) will bound the in-memory array itself by compacting the inert markers a cutover already drops durably | New `pagestore_forkmeta_cutover_test` cases: `test_fork_event_index_selftest` (6 combinations x 2000 events x 4000 queries, all failing checks would surface as a nonzero 1-based check number; a deliberate mutation of `fork_event_upper_bound`'s comparison was confirmed to make it fail) and `test_fork_event_index_scaling` (K=5,000 FSM-pattern rewrites; asserts scan steps < K*128 for the writes, the cutover, and the reopen -- confirmed to fail deterministically with the index disabled: 25,010,000 / 12,507,500 / 12,507,501 steps respectively, versus the unmodified core's now-unreachable ~K^2 cost; measured 0.25s on tmpfs and 2.5s on a disk-backed directory for the whole case); full suite green across three consecutive runs (5512/0 `pagestore_forkmeta_cutover_test` each run, ~6.2s on tmpfs; 2074/0 `pagestore_test`, 273/0 crash matrix, 245/0 lifecycle prune, 151/0 control prune, 93/0 gc, 176/0 wal reclaim core, 73/0 artifact lifecycle, 17043/0 forkmeta prune unaffected); `meson test -C build --suite pagestore` 74/74 (cutover case 41.5s under parallel load, still well inside the 120s timeout); all three fixture checks (store, pgdata, controller) unchanged; `KEEPTMP=1 integration_test.sh` (279 ok) and `mvp_golden_test.sh` (40 ok) both green. `fev_bench.c` (now in-tree, developer tool, not wired into CI/meson) at K=50,000: live path 41.7 -> 11.9 us/write, cutover 0.536 s -> 0.143 s, reopen 1.052 s -> 0.451 s (flat/linear in K instead of quadratic; full table in RELEASE_VALIDATION.md) |
| 2026-09-20 | Resolved both R5-5 follow-ups above. (a) `append_page_impl()` returned the same `-1` for an admission refusal (nothing durable changed) and a real storage failure (bytes may be on disk); `artifact_store_record()`/`ps_artifact_write()` poisoned on either. A `PsAppendOutcome` out-parameter now classifies every return site (`append_page_raw_outcome()`, rc contract unchanged); the lifecycle layer poisons only on a real I/O failure or a sync failure following an appended record; five named, non-poisoning reasons are appended to `PsArtifactRefuseReason` (`_UNFENCED`, `_FORKMETA_CUTOFF`, `_SYNC`, `_LEGACY_BYPASS`, `_IMMUTABLE_MISMATCH`; no `PS_SHM_VERSION` bump, matching #266); `ps_artifact_write` gained the reason out-parameter WRITE never had, and the daemon now logs a WRITE refusal and returns its reason in `ch->result` for `EXTEND`/`WRITEV` on an SLRU/reader-artifact key, which the reader-artifact worker WARNING sites pick up through `edata->message` with no code change of their own. (b) was not a separate hazard: the derivation `cutoff <= frontier <= floor <= every active same-timeline page-history pin` proves a pinned generation is never below the cutoff; the real defect was that `ps_artifact_begin` had no fence check at all, so a BEGIN at an unfenced LSN was admitted pre-cutover (refused on its first WRITE instead) and refused by the forkmeta growth check post-cutover, both misreported and both poisoning under (a)'s bug. `ps_artifact_begin` now calls the same fence predicate the data append uses (`artifact_lsn_fenced()`, extracted so both share it), ordered after the same-LSN completed-generation short-circuit so an immutable re-ship keeps working; the forkmeta growth check remains as defence in depth for one theoretical structural gap and is now named.

| 2026-09-20 | Independent review of the fix above found the core code correct (every `append_page_impl` return site classified right, the BEGIN gate is the exact data-append fence predicate under the same locks, the BEGIN-admitted/pin-dropped-before-WRITE race verified safe) but the tests and docs incomplete: (1) `integration_test.sh`'s `reason=store record` grep could never match, since `PS_ARTIFACT_REFUSE_STORE_RECORD`'s reworded name string is "storage failure recording the lifecycle page ..." -- fixed to grep the stable `reason=storage failure` prefix, with the same correction in the three doc citations of it; (2) B2's BEGIN-time gate made `ps_artifact_write`'s own outcome-classified non-poisoning branch dead in every existing test (restoring blanket poisoning there passed `pagestore_artifact_lifecycle_test` 96/96 unchanged) -- added `test_artifact_write_unfenced_after_pin_drop` (T7, `pagestore_forkmeta_cutover_test.c`): BEGIN admitted at a pinned LSN, the pin is dropped via the daemon's `PS_OP_RETENTION_PIN_DROP` meta op (the raw registry drop does not mark page-prune due), maintenance runs until the frontier passes that LSN, and the attempt's data WRITE -- now unfenced by a legitimate TOCTOU race B2 cannot close -- is refused UNFENCED without poisoning, leaks no fence, and the attempt is cleanly superseded and completes; verified this fails (7 of its 20 checks) with blanket write poisoning restored in a scratch copy. Also: appended `PS_ARTIFACT_REFUSE_RECORD_UNREADABLE` (enum still append-only) for three sites that reused STORE_RECORD's now-misleading "poisoned until reopen" wording for a non-poisoning existing-record read failure (`ps_artifact_begin`/`write`/`drop`); the two plain-append branches in `ps_artifact_write` (unversioned key, legacy token-0 write) now classify their outcome instead of leaving the reason at NONE ("refused before admission"); reworded the `PS_ARTIFACT_REFUSE_SYNC` comments (the pre-record sync's pages are already appended -- what's absent is a COMMIT record indexing them complete, not "nothing durable"); noted in `ARTIFACT_LIFECYCLE.md` that an empty (zero-page) generation at an unfenced LSN is refused at BEGIN exactly like one with pages; corrected the fail-before claims to be precise per test (gate-only removal: one failure each in T1 and T5; blanket-poisoning-only, both guards: zero `pagestore_artifact_lifecycle_test` failures, one `pagestore_forkmeta_cutover_test` failure before T7 existed (T6, whose FORKMETA_CUTOFF-refused BEGIN goes through the same `artifact_store_record()` guard) plus seven more once T7 exists; T2/T4 fail-before is compile-time, not run-time, since the pre-fix `ps_artifact_write` signature and enum do not support what they assert).

| 2026-09-20 | Fixed the F3/Q1 root cause (RELEASE_VALIDATION.md): timeline-delete's `page_cleanup_rewrite_segment()` relocated survivor records into a rebuilt replacement segment and, when covered-prefix bytes moved, rebased the shard's flush watermark to `(seg, 0)` -- the next open then rescanned the whole segment (F3: a pruned ordered marker's record meets no in-memory identity) and, worse, once a later flush moved the watermark again, a survivor's image-index entry (still carrying its pre-rewrite offset) and its true (post-rewrite, relocated) offset could straddle the new watermark so neither the layer replay nor the segment rescan ever found it -- silent loss of already-flushed, acknowledged data with no crash required (Q1). Restored invariant I3 (segment bytes immutable once written, a record's `(seg_id, seg_off)` never changes, the watermark never retreats) by replacing the rewrite with `page_cleanup_tombstone_segment()`: every target record is overwritten in place with a hole record of identical size (body zeroed, magic changed to one of three new `SEG_HOLE48/56/64_MAGIC` values, one per header shape; write order is zero body, then magic, then `sync()` once per segment, so every intermediate state parses either as an ordinary DELETING-timeline record or as a hole), validated in a read-only first pass (so a malformed segment fails closed without writing any hole) before a second pass performs the writes. No survivor is ever relocated, no image-index entry goes stale, the memtable and page index need no update, and space is reclaimed the way any other covered segment already is, by segment GC once the whole segment is below the watermark. Added a cassert-only invariant check in `page_remove_compacted_versions()` (a removed version's segment record must be below the watermark). Renamed the deletion fault points (`timeline_delete.after_segment_rewrite` to `timeline_delete.after_segment_tombstone`) and added `timeline_delete.mid_segment_tombstone` (fires after the first hole of a segment, before the rest), with crash-matrix coverage at both. D5: see the D5 note above (three new `page_segment` identities; `posix-artifact-lifecycle` recaptured with a hole carrying live survivors both before and after it). T7 (repair for a store that deleted a timeline before this fix, so a Q1-affected version can still be lost) is a tracked follow-up, not blocking | `test_hole_record_skipped_on_reopen`/`test_hole_record_bad_len_rejected` (hand-crafted hole bytes; the second proves a hole with a wrong `len` fails closed, distinct from a live record's torn-tail tolerance, since a torn hole write always leaves the pre-tombstone magic in place); `test_timeline_delete_keeps_offsets()` (folds `$SP/f3/q1_test.c`'s three variants -- crash right after the tombstone pass, crash after one more flush, clean close after one more flush -- into one test; fails on the unmodified rewrite in variants 1/2 with survivors unreadable, asserts survivors served with their LSNs, NBLOCKS intact, zero retire/refuse/adopt, the ordered survivor's marker count is 1 after a forced cutover, the shard watermark never retreats, and the segment's byte size right after the tombstone pass equals its size before the deletion); `test_timeline_delete_reclaims_by_segment_gc()`; `test_timeline_delete_crash_matrix()` (both new fault points, with a segment laid out as a compaction-pruned survivor, target records, a live survivor, one more target record -- zero adopt/retire/refuse on reopen, deletion resumes to DELETED, both survivors resolve); `test_deletion_filtered_forkmeta`/`_commit_shape` tightened from `>= 1` to `== 0` adoptions; seven `pagestore_timeline_test.c` cases (`test_deleting_timeline_page_cleanup` and its pure-target variant, `_backpressure_debt`, `_pending_remove`, `_prefix_hole`, `_retired_short_segment`; `_fail_closed` and `_oversized` unchanged) updated from asserting the segment shrinks/empties to asserting it keeps its exact size, with PAGE-debt settlement moved from cleanup-time to segment-GC-reclaim-time; full `meson test --suite pagestore` (74/74) including both regenerated fixture checks (`posix-artifact-lifecycle`, `pgdata-artifacts`) and all renamed/new fault-scenario harness tests green |
| 2026-09-20 | Closed the two residuals left after the `wal`-bound fix (2026-09-19 rows above): (1) a replacement base that becomes durable, or a full-page-image item that arrives, with no retention-registry fence change at all was left to the WAL-index controller's own trigger; `wal_reclaim_raw_dependency_floor` now also records the (key, block, end_lsn) of up to 8 items at the blocking minimum LSN, and a fruitless-suppressed reclaim-due request arms a per-timeline watch naming the exact governing horizon and event kind (a durable version in `[item end, horizon]`, fired from `flush_memtable`; or, for a horizon whose owner holds no page history, a newer FPI item, fired from `walidx_add_batch_locked`) via a new `walidx_horizon_protected_owner()` helper; either fire site bumps a new `walidx_reclaim_base_epoch`, a fourth key the fruitless test checks alongside raw/fence/generation.  (2) a superseded control note that is memtable-resident is invisible to compaction (image layers only) yet counted by `wal_retain_floor_level`, so the WAL floor stuck around for up to 2 MiB of control-shard page writes (the default `flush_pages`) instead of one compaction pass; `retention_effective_floor_internal` gained an optional `pin_floor_out` (the floor before the note-derived WAL term) so the reclaimer can tell "the note term alone holds the boundary" apart from a pin/branch-cap/raw-floor block without a second scan, and when that is so and the note is superseded (not the newest note at or below any live fence, via `control_prune_fences`, and below the operational floor via `control_checkpoint_cutoff`) but not yet `walidx_base_version_durable`, the reclaimer sets `page_flush_requested[shard]`, serviced in `ps_core_maintenance_impl` before the compaction phase-1 scan; `compact_timeline` bumps `wal_reclaim_proof_changed()` once per pass that actually dropped a control-class version (never on an ordinary relation-page compaction, to avoid the v1 per-flush-drain pathology).  Neither residual is exercised by the soak's own workload (it flushes every 8 pages and re-permits the request on every materializer publication anyway), so this is behavior-neutral for it.  (Superseded the same day by the 2026-09-20 review-driven revision below: the base-epoch/`walidx_horizon_protected_owner()` design here was replaced by an unconditional watch keyed on retirement evidence, and the control-note fix here was given a corrected superseded predicate and a dedup key.) | Three new `pagestore_wal_reclaim_core_test` cases -- `test_late_durable_base_requests_compaction`, `test_late_fpi_requests_compaction`, `test_superseded_note_in_memtable_is_pruned` (its own twin-rule negative-half assertions construct a second store where the fence stays live and assert the note is never touched) -- each failing on 316401d8d4b and passing with the fix (207 checks, 0 failures; 5 of those checks fail on the unmodified core); full standalone suite green (`pagestore_test` 2074, `pagestore_gc_test` 93, `pagestore_control_prune_test` 151, `pagestore_lifecycle_prune_test` 245, `pagestore_walidx_snapshot_test` 76, `pagestore_walidx_prune_test` 30, `pagestore_artifact_lifecycle_test` 73 both modes, `pagestore_forkmeta_prune_test` 17043, `pagestore_forkmeta_snapshot_test` 198, `pagestore_fault_test`, `pagestore_timeline_test` 316, `pagestore_backpressure_test` 369, `pagestore_backpressure_daemon_test` 79); reclaim core 3x plain + 1x under `taskset -c 0,1` with 4 busy loops, all green; seed 20260909 at 8000 rounds 5/5 plain (`physical_max.wal` 1785856-1806336 bytes, `wal_fence_slack_max` 1743360 every run) and 3/3 contended, seeds 7 and 4242 at 8000 rounds, and the 2400-round PR-lane default, all green with unchanged bounds |
| 2026-09-21 | Resolved F5 design B, PR 2 of 2 (RELEASE_VALIDATION.md's "Resolved: linear event scans over inert commit markers, and their per-lifetime memory bound (F5)"): bounded the in-memory fork-event array per daemon lifetime, not just per restart. Added a spare `ForkEvent.snapshot_dropped` byte, stamped by the snapshot builder's existing per-entry loop (0 on every branch that emits the event into the checkpoint/tail, 1 on the branch that drops it -- unconditionally 0 under `preserve_survivors`, and never touched for a fork the build skips wholesale as `deleting`); a new `fork_event_compact_dropped_markers()` walks every fork right after a successful publish (same admission/shard/prune/map lock set that serialized the build) and removes every event with `snapshot_dropped && kind > FEV_DEAD` (an inert marker that was never activated to a size event) in place, decrementing `nlegacy_seq` and rebuilding `def_idx`. Recovery-equivalent by construction: what is dropped from memory is exactly what the durable checkpoint no longer carries.

| 2026-09-21 | V4 plan P1 (candidate and delivery validation, `plan-v4-candidate.md`): landed the release-branch sync tooling and the PG-18-candidate groundwork ahead of the `branchdb_18` build. `scripts/branchdb-sync.sh` (`fetch`, `status`, `minor <N> [TAG]`, `forward <FROM> <TO> [TAG]` selecting core-series commits by a `Branchdb-Series: C<n>` trailer, `sync-contrib <branch> <SHA>`, `verify <branch> <SHA>`) replaces the one accidentally removed in 6b92e7c1065; `contrib/pagestore/release-branches.json` (schema 1) is now the source of truth for the supported set (15-19, each with a status/base_tag/contrib_sha) and the unsupported set (13, 14, each with its upstream EOL reason), read by the new `harness/pagestore_release_branches.py`. Guarded the one 19-only include `pagestore_slru.c` had (`access/multixact_internal.h`, `#if PG_VERSION_NUM >= 190000`, else `access/multixact.h`) so the file compiles on 18. Generalized the harness's PG-major and holes-workload assumptions: `PG_MAJORVERSION` is now read from the build (meson passes it as an env var to the two tests that seed a `PG_VERSION` marker file) instead of a literal `"19"`, and `pagestore_pgdata_fixture.py` gained the store checker's `ForeignPayload`-shaped skip rule (a `pg_identity` recorded on a current fixture that does not match the checking build's `pg_control_version`/`xlog_page_magic` is skipped, not failed) plus a matching `--require-build-match` flag; the `posix-timeline-delete-holes` workload-directory match in `pagestore_fixture.py` is now a prefix match so a per-release recapture (e.g. `-pg18`) still gets the extra workload. Updated AGENTS.md (`pagestore` tracks `REL_19_STABLE` by merge, never rebase; `branchdb_N` shape and the `Branchdb-Series` trailer; the release-branch PR rules) and RELEASE_VALIDATION.md (Gaps item 6 and V4 now state the supported set and that 13/14 carry no release evidence). Not in this PR: the `pagestore`-onto-`REL_19_STABLE` merge (P0), the `branchdb_18` build itself (P2), PG-18 fixture capture (P3), the workflow changes that turn on `--require-build-match` for release branches (P4), or INSTALL.md (P5) | `bash -n` and a real dry-run of every `branchdb-sync.sh` command against the live `upstream`/`origin` remotes: `status` printed all seven `branchdb_*` branches' base/commit/merge counts matching the plan's section 1.2 table exactly (e.g. `branchdb_18` 42 commits/2 merges off `REL_18_4+`, `branchdb_19` 41 commits/0 merges off `REL_19_BETA1` exactly); `forward --dry-run pagestore branchdb_18` correctly refused with no commit in range carrying the trailer (today's `pagestore` history predates it, as expected -- P2 adds the trailers when it squashes the core series); `verify branchdb_18 <pagestore SHA>` failed all four check categories (untagged base, 2 merges, differing contrib, 7 untrailered commits) against the real, unsynced branch; `verify branchdb_19 <sha> --build <cassert build> --require-build-match` passed its base/merge/build-match checks and failed only on contrib and trailers; a throwaway scratch clone exercised `forward`'s cherry-pick and `sync-contrib`'s tree copy end-to-end against fabricated `Branchdb-Series` commits, both mechanically correct. `harness/pagestore_release_branches.py` self-test and the full `harness/tests` suite (branch_prepare, materializer_supervisor, plan, bootstrap_install_oracle) pass standalone. `pagestore_slru.c`'s guard verified by grepping `contrib/pagestore` for every other version-specific include the plan flagged (`storage/aio.h`, `utils/wait_classes.h`, `storage/procnumber.h`) against `upstream/REL_18_STABLE` headers -- all present on 18, no further guard needed for this PR.

| 2026-09-21 | Review of the P1 PR above found four blocking issues, fixed as additional commits on the same branch (no history rewrite). (1) The `pagestore_slru.c` guard's "so the file compiles on 18" claim was false: a real compile against a plain `REL_18_6` tree fails on `GetMultiXactInfo()` (no public API exposes `oldestMulti`/`oldestOffset` before 19 -- needs a C4 core export, tracked as a P2 follow-up) and, before this fix, on `MultiXactIdToOffsetPage()`/`MXOffsetToMemberPage()` too (now re-implemented verbatim under the `#else`, since their formula is a pure copy from 18's own `multixact.c`, not a guess). The full, compile-verified list of `contrib/pagestore`'s other version-specific API usage (`ReplOriginId`, `XLogFindNextRecord`'s arity, `xl_multixact_truncate`'s field names, `CHECKPOINT_FAST`, `PageSetChecksum`, and more) is now tracked in the new `contrib/pagestore/PG_MAJOR_PORTABILITY.md`, which also carries the C1-C7 core-series table (previously only in the out-of-tree V4 plan) -- closing that list is a separate "PG 18 compatibility guards" PR built from P2's work, not this one. (2) `sync-contrib` could fold unrelated staged changes or untracked files under `contrib/pagestore` into the sync commit, and a no-op rerun exited 1 instead of 0; it now requires a clean index and no untracked files under `contrib/pagestore` up front, verifies byte-identity on the index (`git diff --cached`) before committing rather than after, exits 0 cleanly when the tree already matches, and requires the given SHA to be an ancestor of `origin/pagestore`. (3) `pagestore_pgdata_fixture.py --require-build-match` was vacuous for a current fixture with no `pg_identity` (passed with no proof of a match); it now fails that case, matching the store checker's stricter rule, and `--capture` now refuses to silently carry a stale `pg_identity` forward on a recapture that wasn't given a fresh identity source (new `--keep-pg-identity` opt-out). RELEASE_VALIDATION.md notes that the existing `pgdata-artifacts` fixture needs recapturing before any workflow turns the flag on for it. (4) Doc corrections: the manifest (`release-branches.json`) is hand-maintained -- nothing in the script writes `base_tag`/`contrib_sha` automatically, corrected in AGENTS.md and the reader's docstring; `status` now genuinely invokes `pagestore_release_branches.py` (`--major`/`--field`) instead of duplicating its JSON-parsing logic inline; `branchdb_18`'s `release-branches.json` status reverted from `"candidate"` to `"planned"` (it does not become a candidate until P6 promotes it). Advisory fixes also applied: `forward` uses `git switch -C` for a fresh staging branch, resumes onto an already-existing one instead of force-resetting it (preserving prior conflict resolutions), prints the resolve-and-continue hint even when `set -e` would otherwise skip past it, and selects commits by the same strict `Branchdb-Series: C[1-7]$` pattern `verify` uses; `verify`'s base-tag check now requires the tag to match `REL_<v>_*` (not any exact-match tag), and its `--build DIR` now requires DIR to be a configured build for `<branch>`'s own major (checked via `pg_config.h`) | All four blocking fixes verified with real, non-dry-run exercises in throwaway scratch clones (deleted after): `sync-contrib` -- untracked-file refusal, staged-change refusal, non-ancestor-SHA refusal, a real sync, and a no-op rerun exiting 0, all observed; `forward` -- a real cherry-pick conflict against a seeded pre-existing file, the resolve hint printing before the conflicting `git cherry-pick` command's nonzero exit would otherwise have ended the script, resuming after resolution without resetting the rc branch, and a clean rerun correctly reporting "nothing to cherry-pick" once both commits were applied. `pagestore_pgdata_fixture.py`: `--check --require-build-match` against the existing (unstamped) `pgdata-artifacts` fixture now FAILs (previously passed vacuously); the identical check without `--require-build-match` still passes (20/20 mutation cases); `--capture` without an identity source now refuses when a previous `pg_identity` exists, succeeds with `--keep-pg-identity`, and a fresh capture with `--postgres-payload-identity-tool` records `pg_identity` correctly -- exercised against a real capture from `PAGESTORE_PGDATA_FIXTURE_CAPTURE`. `pagestore_slru.c`'s new macros compile cleanly as part of the PG-19 `pagestore.so` build (the `#else` branch itself cannot be exercised without an 18 build, which is still P2's job). `harness/pagestore_release_branches.py`'s `--major`/`--field` mode verified directly and via `scripts/branchdb-sync.sh status`'s real output; the reader's self-test still passes with `branchdb_18` at `status: "planned"`. Full re-run: `meson test --suite pagestore` and the three fixture checks with `--require-build-match` plus the `pagestore_fixture_identities.py` (#269) guard, all green (see the run recorded the same day this row was added) |
| 2026-09-21 | Fixed L6 (RELEASE_VALIDATION.md, "Resolved: torn-tail garbage stalled a timeline deletion (L6)"): `page_cleanup_tombstone_segment()`'s pass 1 validated a segment's whole file and failed the entire pass closed, forever, on any torn tail (an append cut short mid-crash), a sealed segment's rollover garbage, or (on SPDK) the unwritten zero-padded tail past the last real record -- bytes `recover()` itself already treats as end of log and never replays. `timeline_delete_page_cleanup_one()` also dropped a failed scan's `-1` on the floor with no diagnostic, so a stalled deletion sat silently in DELETING forever. Fixed by invariant I4 (the reachable region): pass 1 now validates only `[0, R)`, where `R` is exactly where `recover()`'s own end-of-log rule would stop, further bounded by the append cursor (`cur_off`) for the segment currently being appended to; everything at or beyond `R` is untouched, matching `recover()`'s existing "retirement is logical, not physical" treatment of the same bytes. Pass 1 still fails closed on a nonzero unknown magic, a hole record with the wrong `len`, or a complete record naming an impossible timeline -- all corruption *inside* the reachable region, not a torn tail. Pass 2 carries a cassert-only assertion that no hole write ever lands at or beyond the cursor. `timeline_delete_page_cleanup_one()` now logs a once-per-tuple "deletion blocked" diagnostic instead of retrying silently. No format/migration change (D5: none); the SPDK paragraph in RELEASE_VALIDATION.md is reworded from "cannot complete" to "unvalidated" (D6 unchanged) now that the structural zero-padding blocker is gone | `pagestore_timeline_test.c`: `test_deleting_timeline_page_cleanup_torn_tail` (fail-before: DELETING after 48 maintenance turns, 0 holes; passes after: DELETED, exactly 2 holes below the valid boundary, the 156 torn bytes byte-identical before/after); `_sealed_torn_tail` (same fail-before shape, torn tail in a segment that later rolls over so no cursor applies to it; 1 hole in the sealed segment, segment 1 untouched); `_retired_torn_tail` (missing-ordered-marker retirement, `use_layers=0`, plus a torn tail after close; same fail-before shape; the sentinel still rolls the next write to segment 1); `_zero_tail` (4096 zero bytes appended, the SPDK shape on POSIX; same fail-before shape; the zeros are never written); `_fail_closed` reworked to corrupt the second record's magic in place, below the cursor, inside the reachable region (a contract guard, not a fail-before: still DELETING after 16 turns, 0 holes, plus the new "deletion blocked" diagnostic asserted exactly once across the 16 turns); `_garbage_beyond_cursor_is_ignored` (the flipped expectation of the old `_fail_closed` tail-append step: 4 bytes of unknown-magic garbage exactly at the cursor now completes to DELETED, untouched -- fail-before: DELETING after 16 turns). `pagestore_forkmeta_cutover_test.c`: `test_timeline_delete_torn_tail_crash_matrix` (a real crash via `PAGESTORE_TEST_CRASH_AFTER_SEG_WRITES`, not a hand-crafted file -- a survivor's own append is killed after its header write, body never written; fail-before: deletion never reaches DELETED; passes after: DELETED, holes only below the recovered cursor read off the reopen log line, torn bytes byte-identical, zero retire/refuse/adopt lines). All six new/reworked cases fail on the pre-fix tree and pass with the fix (verified by reverting only `pagestore_core.c` in a scratch copy and rerunning both binaries). `pagestore_timeline_test` 400/400 (was 330/330); `pagestore_forkmeta_cutover_test` 5815/5815 (was 5800/5800, +15 from the new crash-matrix case); full `meson test -C build --suite pagestore` 76/76; `pagestore_format_versions` and all three fixture checks unchanged; standalone `-O2 -Wall -Wextra -Werror` compiles of `pagestore_core.c`, `pagestore_timeline_test.c`, and `pagestore_forkmeta_cutover_test.c` clean; `KEEPTMP=1 integration_test.sh` and `mvp_golden_test.sh` both green; `pagestore_soak` (2400 rounds) green |
| 2026-09-21 | pagestore: PG 18 compatibility guards for `contrib/pagestore` (V4 P2 addendum). Cherry-picked `396c5033768` (the RC-side compat commit built and hand-verified against a plain `branchdb_18-rc`) onto `pagestore` so the same `#if PG_VERSION_NUM` guards -- `ReplOriginId`/`RepOriginId`, the SLRU control-struct `options` shim (`PS_SLRU_OPT`), `XLogFindNextRecord()`'s dropped `errormsg` out-param, the `xl_multixact_truncate` field rename, `pagestore_planner()`'s dropped `ExplainState *`, `PageSetChecksum`/`CHECKPOINT_FAST`/`BGWORKER_INTERRUPTIBLE` renames, the two 19-only `CheckPoint`/`ControlFileData` fields, `PG_MULTIXACT_MEMBERS_LONG_NAMES`, `pagestore_control_restore.c`'s frontend-safe `SLRU_PAGES_PER_SEGMENT` alias, and `integration_test.sh`'s two hardcoded 19-only multixact-geometry assumptions -- live on `contrib/pagestore` itself (AGENTS.md's byte-identity rule: a release branch's `sync-contrib` cannot special-case its own copy). Also landed the gap the RC commit left documented but unfixed: `backend_localsvc.c`'s pinned-reader deny-list had no case for 18's `T_ClusterStmt` (19 unifies CLUSTER/VACUUM FULL into `T_RepackStmt`, confirmed against both `upstream/REL_18_STABLE`'s and this tree's `parsenodes.h`), so CLUSTER on an 18 pinned reader fell through to the `wal_insert_restricted` PANIC backstop instead of a clean ERROR; added the `#if PG_VERSION_NUM < 190000` `T_ClusterStmt` case (VACUUM FULL needs no separate case: it is still a plain `T_VacuumStmt` on 18, already denied unconditionally by the existing case). `pagestore_slru.c`'s lone pre-existing guard (the `access/multixact_internal.h`/`access/multixact.h` include) was not yet present on `pagestore` HEAD (bf163d2f221) at cherry-pick time; added it directly so the result carried exactly one instance. `#275` ("correct `PG_MAJOR_PORTABILITY.md`'s 18 facts; fix capture ordering") landed on `pagestore` while this branch was in flight, bringing its own canonical guard (with the `MultiXactIdToOffsetPage()`/`MXOffsetToMemberPage()` re-implementation under the `#else`, which this branch's own guard did not have) and its own `PG_MAJOR_PORTABILITY.md`; rebased onto it (`5baede51d0f`), resolving so `pagestore_slru.c` keeps exactly #275's guard plus this PR's `PS_SLRU_OPT` shim after it (nothing duplicated, re-verified by compiling against the rc overlay again post-rebase) and `PG_MAJOR_PORTABILITY.md` is #275's document with its API-surface table updated to "guarded in this PR" for every row this PR's guards (and the `T_ClusterStmt` fix) actually cover, keeping the two documented, not-silent limitations (`CheckPoint.dataChecksumState`/`ControlFileData.dataChecksumState`, a forward risk for P0's `REL_19_STABLE` merge rather than an 18 gap -- neither it nor `logicalDecodingEnabled` is actually present on 18 at all, per #275's own correction; and 18's 32-bit members-offset space, which is not given wraparound-aware seeding here -- `pagestore_seed_multixact()`'s own `oldest_member > next_member` check already fails it closed rather than mis-seeding) | 19 (no behavior change): cassert `meson setup`/`ninja` clean (only a pre-existing, unrelated `-Wdeclaration-after-statement`/`-Wshadow` warning elsewhere in `pagestore_core.c`/`pagestore.c`, neither touched by this PR); every `#if PG_VERSION_NUM >= 190000` branch confirmed taken (`PG_VERSION_NUM` 190000 in the build) and each guarded macro's 19+ expansion confirmed textually identical to the pre-guard code (`XLogFindNextRecord(state, ptr, errmsgp)`, `.oldestMulti`/`.oldestOffset`, `PG_MULTIXACT_MEMBERS_LONG_NAMES` = `true`, etc.); `meson test --suite setup` 3/3; `meson test --suite pagestore` 76/76; `KEEPTMP=1 integration_test.sh`, `mvp_golden_test.sh`, `branch_boot_test.sh` all PASS. 18: `git diff origin/branchdb_18-rc -- contrib/pagestore` against this PR's tree is empty except the `T_ClusterStmt` case and this doc (byte-identity holds once both land); compile-verified by overlaying this PR's `contrib/pagestore` onto a scratch `branchdb_18-rc` worktree and building the full tree (cassert): `meson test --suite setup` 3/3, `meson test --suite pagestore` 76/76, `KEEPTMP=1 integration_test.sh` PASS including a scratch-only added assertion (`CLUSTER reader_t USING reader_t_pkey` on the pinned reader returns the clean "not allowed on a pinned reader" ERROR, not a PANIC) proving the `T_ClusterStmt` fix; no persisted format change |
| 2026-09-21 | Rebased the PG 18 compatibility guards PR (previous row) onto `#275` (`5baede51d0f`, merged while this branch was in flight), which landed its own corrected `pagestore_slru.c` include guard (with the `MultiXactIdToOffsetPage()`/`MXOffsetToMemberPage()` re-implementation under the `#else`) and its own `PG_MAJOR_PORTABILITY.md`. Resolved so `pagestore_slru.c` carries exactly #275's guard plus this PR's `PS_SLRU_OPT` shim after it (`git diff origin/pagestore -- contrib/pagestore/pagestore_slru.c` is a clean, additive-only diff -- no duplicated guard), `PG_MAJOR_PORTABILITY.md` is #275's document with its table's "not yet guarded" statuses updated to "guarded in this PR" (keeping the same two documented limitations, and folding in #275's corrections that `logicalDecodingEnabled`/`dataChecksumState` are absent on 18, not present-but-uncompared as an earlier unverified guess in this doc had it), and `backend_localsvc.c`'s `T_ClusterStmt` case merged cleanly (no conflict). Re-verifying the rebased tree surfaced a real cross-branch build conflict, documented in `PG_MAJOR_PORTABILITY.md` right after its table rather than silently worked around: `branchdb_18-rc`'s own C4 core series independently made `MultiXactIdToOffsetPage()`/`MXOffsetToMemberPage()` non-`static`, exported from `multixact.c` for contrib's use -- written before #275's guard existed, on the assumption contrib would call the export rather than reimplement the formula. #275's guard does the latter, so the two collide (`static declaration ... follows non-static declaration`) on a real `branchdb_18-rc` build. Confirmed by compiling this PR's `contrib/pagestore` against a real `branchdb_18-rc` checkout; confirmed the fix belongs on `branchdb_18-rc` (dropping its now-redundant export back to `static`, keeping only its still-needed `GetMultiXactInfo()` export) by applying it in a throwaway scratch worktree only, where the full matrix then went green. Not fixed on `pagestore` or in this PR: `contrib/pagestore` itself is correct and byte-identical either way; the conflict is `branchdb_18-rc`-side and out of this PR's scope | Rebuilt PG 19 (cassert) clean; `meson test --suite pagestore` 77/77 (was 76/76 pre-rebase, +1 from #275's own new test); the fixture-identities guard exit 0 against the exact 7-fixture set `meson.build` checks; `KEEPTMP=1 integration_test.sh` PASS. `git diff --name-only origin/branchdb_18-rc -- contrib/pagestore` limited to this PR's own files (`backend_localsvc.c`, `pagestore_slru.c`, `PG_MAJOR_PORTABILITY.md`, `MVP_COMPLETION_PLAN.md`) plus files that differ only because `pagestore` has moved past the RC's `37e8d749051` sync point or because #275 added new sync tooling, none touched by this PR (`fev_bench.c`, `pagestore_core.c`, `pagestore_forkmeta_cutover_test.c`, `MVP_STATUS.md`, `RELEASE_VALIDATION.md`, `harness/pagestore_fixture.py`, `harness/pagestore_pgdata_fixture.py`, `harness/pagestore_release_branches.py`, two `harness/tests/*.py`, `meson.build`, `release-branches.json`). Compile-verified on 18 again post-rebase: a scratch `branchdb_18-rc` worktree overlaid with just this PR's `backend_localsvc.c`/`pagestore_slru.c` reproduced the `MultiXactIdToOffsetPage`/`MXOffsetToMemberPage` conflict above; with that one line (the export) reverted to `static` in the scratch copy only, the same overlay built clean and `meson test --suite pagestore` (76/76), `KEEPTMP=1 integration_test.sh` (PASS, including the `T_ClusterStmt` `CLUSTER` scratch assertion) both went green; scratch worktree discarded, `branchdb_18-rc` itself untouched |
| 2026-09-21 | V4 plan P4 (CI for release branches and soak coverage, `plan-v4-candidate.md`): `pagestore-test.yml`'s in-engine store- and pgdata-fixture-check steps now pass `--require-build-match` whenever the ref (or a pull request's base) is `pagestore`, or a `branchdb_<N>` branch whose major `release-branches.json` does not list as unsupported -- a new preparatory step reads that per-major decision from the manifest via `harness/pagestore_release_branches.py` instead of hardcoding a second `branchdb_13`/`branchdb_14`-shaped exclusion next to the existing scenario skips, which stay as they were. The pgdata step's flag is deliberately inert for now (`pagestore_pgdata_fixture.py` only enforces it once also given `--postgres-payload-identity[-tool]`, not wired in here): turning it on for real before the checked-in `pgdata-artifacts` fixture is recaptured with `pg_identity` would fail it unconditionally on `pagestore` itself (RELEASE_VALIDATION.md gap 6) -- passing the flag now means enforcement starts the day that recapture lands, no further workflow change needed. `pagestore-nightly.yml` gained a `ref` dispatch input (branch/tag/SHA, honoured by the existing `SOAK_REF`/`gh api commits/<ref>` resolution) and a weekly `release-plan`/`release-soak` job pair (Sunday 05:17 UTC) that fans the same soak out over every branch `release-branches.json` marks `candidate` or `released` (empty today -- no major has been promoted past `planned`), guarded the same way the existing daily schedule is; a `pagestore-candidate-*` ref now gets 90-day artifact retention instead of the usual 30. New `pagestore-release-acceptance.yml` (`contrib/pagestore/RELEASE_ACCEPTANCE.md`): triggered by a `pagestore-candidate-*` tag (or a `workflow_dispatch` naming one, refusing anything that is not an actual tag), it resolves the tag to a SHA and runs both CI lanes against that exact commit (`--require-build-match` unconditional), a 3-seed x 8000-round soak, and bundles every job's JSON reports, integration logs, fixture-check output, `pagestore_control_restore --payload-identity`, `pagestore_format_versions` and `git describe` into one `evidence-<tag>.tar.gz`, retained 90 days. `RELEASE_VALIDATION.md`'s V4 section and `MVP_COMPLETION_PLAN.md` (this row) record the change; these commits are staged to be cherry-picked onto `branchdb_18-rc` (before P6) so the release branch carries working CI of its own rather than relying on `pagestore`'s copy -- `branchdb_18-rc` currently has no `.github/workflows/` at all (P2 built it from `REL_18_6`, which predates `pagestore`'s workflow files) | `python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(...)"` on all three workflow files; the preparatory per-major step and the weekly release-branch matrix step extracted verbatim into scratch scripts and run against the real `contrib/pagestore/release-branches.json` (`pagestore`/`master`/`branchdb_15..19`/`branchdb_18-rc` -> `supported=true`; `branchdb_13`/`branchdb_14` -> `supported=false`; the weekly matrix step correctly reports `combos=[]`/`has_combos=false` today, since no major is yet `candidate`/`released`); the `--require-build-match` boolean expression reasoned against GitHub's expression syntax and documented as a truth table in both fixture-check steps' comments; `actionlint`/`act` not available in this environment (noted, same as prior PRs) |
